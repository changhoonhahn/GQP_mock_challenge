\section{Results} \label{sec:results}
%\subsection{Inferred Galaxy Properties}
The goal of this work is to demonstrate the precision and accuracy of inferred
galaxy properties for PROVABGS. 
We apply our SED modeling to the mock observables of \todo{100} \lgal~galaxies.
From the posterior distributions of the SPS parameters, we derive the following
physical galaxy properties: stellar mass ($M_*$), SFR averaged over 1 Gyr
($\avgsfr$), mass-weighted stellar metallicity ($Z_{\rm MW}$), and diffuse-dust
optical depth ($\tau_{\rm ISM}$).
$M_*$ and $\tau_{\rm ISM}$ are both SPS model parameters. 
We derive $\avgsfr$ and $Z_{\rm MW}$ as 
\begin{equation}
    \avgsfr = \frac{\int\limits_{t_{\rm age} - {\rm 1 Gyr}}^{t_{\rm age}}{\rm
    SFH}(t)\,{\rm d}t}{{\rm 1 Gyr}} \quad{\rm and}\quad
    Z_{\rm MW} = \frac{\int\limits_0^{t_{\rm age}}{\rm SFH}(t)\,{\rm
    ZH}(t)\,{\rm d}t}{M_*}.
\end{equation} 

In Figure~\ref{fig:prop_inf}, we compare the galaxy properties inferred from
SED modeling the mock observations, $\hat{\theta}$ to the true (input) galaxy
properties, $\theta_{\rm true}$ of the simulated galaxies.
In each column, we compare $\log M_*$, $\log \avgsfr$, $\log Z_{\rm MW}$,
$\tage$, and $\tauism$ from left to right.  
The inferred properties in the top, middle, and bottom rows are derived from
SED modeling of spectra, photometry, and spectrophotometry, respectively.
In each panel, we plot $\hat{\theta}$ using a violin plot, where the width
of the marker represents the marginalized posterior distribution of $\theta$. 
We note that in the comparison with SED modeling spectra only, we do not
include $f_{\rm fiber}$. 
Therefore, the true stellar mass in this case corresponds to $f_{\rm fiber}
\times M_*$. 
\emph{Overall, the comparison demonstrates that we can robustly infer galaxy
properties using the {\sc PROVABGS} SED modeling}. 

In more detail, we find that we infer unbiased and precise constraints on
$M_*$ throughout the entire $M_*$ range. 
%For spectra+photometry SED modeling, the posteriors have $\sigma_{M_*}\sim0.06$ dex.
We also infer robust $\avgsfr$ above $\log \avgsfr > -1$ dex; below this limit,
however, the inferred $\avgsfr$ are significantly less precise and
overestimate the true $\avgsfr$. 
This bias at low $\avgsfr$ is caused by model priors, which we discuss in
further detail later in \todo{Section~\ref{sec:discuss} and
Appendix~\ref{sec:model_priors}}. 
Both $Z_{\rm MW}$ and $\tage$ are not precisely constrained. 
However, Figure~\ref{fig:prop_inf} does not exhibit clear biases in the
constraints.
For $\tage$, the posteriors reveal the log-spaced $\tlb$ binning used in our
SPS model for $\tage > 6$ Gyr.
Lastly, $\tauism$ is overally accurately inferred for galaxies with low
$\tauism$ but appears to be underestimated for for high $\tauism$.

The overall constraints on galaxy properties for the mock observations is
especially encouraging due to the significant differences in the forward
model used to generate the observations and the SPS model used in the SED
modeling. 
First, the SFHs in the mock observations are taken directly from \lgal~simulation
outputs while the SFH parameterization in the SPS model is based on NMF bases fit
to IllustrisTNG galaxy SFHs.
Second, in the forward model, we construct the SED of the bulge and disk
components of the simulated galaxies separately: the components have separate
SFHs and ZHs. 
Lastly, we use different dust prescriptions: \cite{mathis1983} dust attenuation  
curve in the forward model and \cite{kriek2013} dust attenuation curve in the
SPS model. 
Despite these significant differences, our constraints on certain galaxy
properties are unbiased and precise. 

Figure~\ref{fig:prop_inf}, also highlights the advantages of jointly modeling
spectra and photometry. 
Comparing the constraints from spectrophotometry to photometry alone, we find
that including spectra significantly tightens the constraints for all
properties. 
In addition to tightening constraints, including spectra also appears to reduce
biases of the constraints. 
For instance, with only photometry, we derive significantly more biased
$\avgsfr$ constraints.
This is due to the limited constraining power of photometry, which allows the
posteriors to be dominated by model priors. 
Adding spectra, significantly increases the contribution of the likelihood and
ameliorates this effect. 
%Therefore, joint SED modeling of spectra and photometry 

Beyond qualitative comparisons of the posterior, we want to quantify the
precision and accuracy of the inferred galaxy properties. 
Let $\Delta_{\theta,i}$ be the discrepancy between the inferred and true
parameters for each galaxy: 
$\Delta_{\theta,i} = \hat{\theta}_i - \theta^{\rm true}_i$.
Then, if we assume that $\Delta_{\theta,i}$ are sampled from a Gaussian
distribution,
\begin{equation} \label{eq:eta_gauss}
    \Delta_{\theta,i} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_{\Delta_{\theta}}, \sigma_{\Delta_{\theta}}),
\end{equation}
the mean ($\mu_{\Delta_{\theta}}$) and standard deviation
($\sigma_{\Delta_{\theta}}$) of the distribution are population hyperparameters
that represent the accuracy and precision of the inferred posteriors for the
galaxy population. 
We can derive $\mu_{\Delta_{\theta}}$ and $\sigma_{\Delta_{\theta}}$ using a
hierarchical Bayesian framework~\citep[\emph{e.g.}][]{hogg2010,
foreman-mackey2014, baronchelli2020}.

Let $\{{\bfi X}_i\}$ represent the photometry or spcetrum of a galaxy
population and $\eta_\Delta = \{\mu_{\Delta_{\theta}},
\sigma_{\Delta_{\theta}}\}$ be the population hyperparameters.
Our goal is to constrain $\eta_\Delta$ from $\{{\bfi X}_i\}$ --- \emph{i.e.}
$p(\eta_\Delta \given \{{\bfi X}_i\})$.
As usual, we can expand 
\begin{align}
p(\eta_\Delta \given \{{\bfi X_i}\}) 
    =&~\frac{p(\eta_\Delta)~p( \{{\bfi X_i}\} \given \eta_\Delta)}{p(\{{\bfi X_i}\})}\\
    =&~\frac{p(\eta_\Delta)}{p(\{{\bfi X_i}\})}\int p(\{{\bfi X_i}\} \given \{\theta_i\})~p(\{\theta_i\} \given \eta_\Delta)~{\rm d}\{\theta_i\}.
\intertext{
    $\theta_i$ is the SPS parameters for galaxy $i$ and $p(\{{\bfi X_i}\}
    \given \{\theta_i\})$ is likelihood of the set of observations $\{{\bfi
    X_i}\}$ given the set of $\{\theta_i\}$. 
    Since the likelihoods for each of the $N$ galaxies, $p(\bfi X_i \given
    \theta_i)$, are not correlated, we can factorize and write the expression
    above as 
}
    =&~\frac{p(\eta_\Delta)}{p(\{{\bfi X_i}\})}\prod\limits_{i=1}^N\int p({\bfi X_i} \given \theta_i)~p(\theta_i \given \theta_\Delta)~{\rm d}\theta_i\\
    =&~\frac{p(\eta_\Delta)}{p(\{{\bfi X_i}\})}\prod\limits_{i=1}^N\int
    \frac{p(\theta_i \given {\bfi X_i})~p({\bfi X_i})}{p(\theta_i)}~p(\theta_i
    \given \eta_\Delta)~{\rm d}\theta_i\\
    =&~p(\eta_\Delta)\prod\limits_{i=1}^N\int \frac{p(\theta_i \given {\bfi
    X_i})~p(\theta_i \given \eta_\Delta)}{p(\theta_i)}~{\rm d}\theta_i. 
\intertext{
    $p(\theta_i \given {\bfi X_i})$ is the posterior for an individual galaxy,
    so the integral can be estimated using the Monte Carlo samples from the
    posterior: 
}
    \approx&~p(\eta_\Delta)\prod\limits_{i=1}^N\frac{1}{S_i}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{S_i}
    \frac{p(\theta_{i,j} \given \eta_\Delta)}{p(\theta_{i,j})}.
\end{align} 
$S_i$ is the number of posterior samples and $\theta_{i,j}$ is the $j^{\rm th}$
sample of galaxy $i$.
In practice,
$p(\theta_{i,j} \given \eta_\Delta) = p(\Delta_{\theta,i,j} \given
\eta_\Delta)$ is a Gaussian distribution and, hence, easy to evaluate. 
$p(\theta_{i,j}) = 1$ since we use uninformative and Dirichlet priors
(Table~\ref{tab:params}). 
Lastly, we sample the $p(\eta_\Delta \given \{{\bfi X_i}\})$ distribution using
MCMC.

In each panel, we derive $p(\eta_\Delta \given \{{\bfi X_i}\})$ for

We also include $\log\zmw$ $\{\mu_{\Delta_\theta}, \sigma_{\Delta_\theta}\}$
for simulated galaxies with $r_{\rm fiber} > 20$ (black dot-dashed) and
$\tauism$ $\{\mu_{\Delta_\theta}, \sigma_{\Delta_\theta}\}$ for galaxies
without bulges (black dotted), which we discuss later.

        $r_{\rm fiber}$ and $r$ magnitudes are proxies for SNR of spectra and

        We find a significant dependence on spectral SNR in the inferred

        When the spectral SNR is low ($r_{\rm fiber} > 20$), the prior on

In Figure~\ref{fig:eta_photo}, we examine how the accuracy and precision of
our galaxy parameter constraints are impacted by signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or
photometric color. 
We present $\eta_\Delta$ of our joint SED modeling of spectra and photometry as
a function of $r_{\rm fiber}$, $r$, $g-r$, and $r-z$. 
$r_{\rm fiber}$ and $r$ magnitudes serve proxies of the SNR for the spectra and
photometry, respectively. 
In each row, we plot $\eta_\Delta$ for a different galaxy property: $\log M_*$,
$\avgsfr$, $\log Z_{\rm MW}$, $\tage$ and $\tauism$ (from top to bottom).

Lastly, in Figure~\ref{fig:etas_msfr}, we investigate whether there are any
underlying systematic dependence in the inferred galaxy properties on the  
$M_*$-${\rm SFR}$ plane. 
In the top and bottom panels, we present $\mu_{\Delta_{\theta}}$ and 
$\sigma_{\Delta_{\theta}}$ in $(\log M_*, \log\avgsfr)$ bins for 
$\log M_*$, $\log\avgsfr$, $\log Z_{\rm MW}$, $\tage$ and $\tauism$ (left to
right).
We use $\log M_*$ bins of 0.225 dex width and $\log\avgsfr$ bins of width 
0.25 dex for $\log \avgsfr > 0$ dex and 0.5 dex for $\log \avgsfr < 0$ dex. 
We only present bins with more than 10 galaxies. 
On the $M_*-{\rm SFR}$ plane, we can examine whether the accuracy and precision
of the inferred properties have significant dependencies for galaxy type.\\ 

% log M*
\noindent \underline{\emph{Inferred $\log M_*$}}: 
Overall, we infer accurate and precise $\log M_*$ from our {\sc PROVABGS} SED
modeling. 
First, there is no significant dependence in $\mu_{\Delta_{\theta}}$ and 
$\sigma_{\Delta_{\theta}}$ with $\log M_*$ throughout the $\log M_*$ range. 
This means that we accurately infer the true $M_*$ throughout ${\sim}10^{9} -
10^{12} M_\odot$  with uniform precision of $\sigma_{\Delta_{\log M_*}} \sim 0.1$ dex. 
We also find no significant dependence on SNR dependence for $M_*$ ---
neither $r_{\rm fiber}$ nor $r$ magnitudes affect $\mu_{\Delta_{\log M_*}}$ and 
$\sigma_{\Delta_{\log M_*}}$.
There is a noticeable correlation with $g-r$ and $r-z$ color, which also
appears in the $M_*-{\rm SFR}$ plane. 
However, the effect of this correlation is small $< 0.1$ dex, especially
considering the ${\sim}0.1$ dex accuracy of our inferred posterior on 
$\log M_*$. \\

% log SFR 
\noindent \underline{\emph{Inferred $\log\avgsfr$}}: 
We infer accurate $\log\avgsfr$ for galaxies with $\log\avgsfr > -1$ dex with
${\sim} 0.1$ dex precision. 
Below this limit, we significantly overestimate $\log \avgsfr$, consistent with
the bias in Figure~\ref{fig:prop_inf}. 
In fact, we find a $\log \avgsfr \sim -1$ dex lower bound for the inferred
$\log \avgsfr$. 
At $\log\avgsfr < -1$ dex, we also find that the constraints are significantly
broader with $\sigma_{\Delta_{\log M_*}} \sim 0.25 - 0.3$ dex.
Comparing $\mu_{\Delta_{\theta}}$ and $\sigma_{\Delta_{\theta}}$ from
spectrophotometry versus from only photometry, we confirm that including
spectra significantly improves the accuracy and tightens the $\log\avgsfr$
constraints.
For $\avgsfr$ below $\log\avgsfr < -1$ dex, the bias is reduced by ${\sim}1$
dex --- an order of magnitude. 

We find no significant correlation between the accuracy and precision of
$\avgsfr$ with spectral or photometric SNR.
Meanwhile, there is a more significant color dependence where we overestimate
$\log\avgsfr$ by $\mu_{\Delta_{\log\avgsfr}}>0.5$ dex for the reddest galaxies
($g-r > 1.5$ and $r-z> 0.6$).
The constraints for these galaxies are also significantly less precise:
$\sigma_{\Delta_{\log\avgsfr}} \sim 0.5$ dex. 
The bias is also apparent in Figure~\ref{fig:etas_msfr}. 
There is significant bias in the inferrd for quiescent galaxies where we
overestimate $\avgsfr$. 
$\avgsfr$ is also slightly underestimated for the most massive ($M_* >
10^{11}M_\odot$) star-forming galaxies. 
These biases are consequences of our SPS model priors.
$\avgsfr$ is a derived quantity; hence, the uniform priors we impose on SPS
parameters induce non-uniform priors on them.
Our SPS model imposes a prior on $\log \overline{\rm SSFR}_{\rm 1 Gyr}$
that is skewed and peaks at ${\sim}-10.4$ dex (Appendix~\ref{sec:model_priors}, Figure~\ref{fig:model_priors}). 
Consequently, the posterior overestimates $\avgsfr$ at low $\avgsfr$ (red,
quiescent galaxies) and underestimates $\avgsfr$ at the highest $\avgsfr$. \\

% log Z_MW  
\noindent \underline{\emph{Inferred $\log\zmw$}}:  
Unlike in Figure~\ref{fig:prop_inf}, $\eta_\Delta$ in Figure~\ref{fig:etas}
clearly reveal the accuracy and precision of the posteriors on $\log\zmw$. 
We find that $\mu_{\Delta_{\theta}}$ depends significantly on the true $\zmw$: 
inferred $\log\zmw$ is overestimated by ${\sim}0.2$ dex below $\log\zmw <
-2$ dex and slightly underestimated at the highest $\log\zmw > -1.6$ dex.
$\sigma_{\Delta_\theta} \sim 0.15$ dex is uniform throughout the $\zmw$ range.
Similar to $\avgsfr$, the bias in inferred $\zmw$ is a consequence of our SPS
model priors. 
The prior skews $\log\zmw$ constraints towards the peak of the prior at
$\log\zmw\sim-1.5$. 
Figure~\ref{fig:etas}, also include $\eta_\Delta$ for posteriors derived from
photometry alone (orange). 
This demonstrates that including DESI spectra substantially improves the
accuracy of the $\log\zmw$ constraints --- spectra reduces the overall bias on
$\zmw$ by $\sim0.3$ dex. 
The improvement comes from the likelihood contribution from DESI spectra
reducing the relative contribution of the prior on the posterior. 

In Figure~\ref{fig:eta_photo}, we find that the posteriors overestimate
$\log\zmw$ at $r_{\rm fiber} > 20$. 
These correspond to mock observations with low spectral SNR and further
demonstrate the constraining power of DESI spectra. 
Low spectral SNR means that the contribution of the likelihood from the spectra
is reduced so the prior on $\log\zmw$ has a larger effect. 
The color dependence of $\mu_{\Delta_\theta}$ for $\zmw$ in
Figure~\ref{fig:eta_photo} is a consequence of this spectral SNR dependence; so
is the $M_*-{\rm SFR}$ dependence (Figure~\ref{fig:etas_msfr}. 
If we exclude galaxies with low spectral SNR, both the color and $M_*-{\rm
SFR}$  dependences are substantially reduced.
More quantitatively, we present $\eta_\Delta$ for only $r_{\rm fiber} < 20$
galaxies in Figure~\ref{fig:etas} (black dot-dashed): we infer $\log\zmw$ with
$\mu_{\Delta_\theta}<0.15$ dex and $\sigma_{\Delta_\theta}\sim0.1$ . \\

% t_age, MW 
\noindent \underline{\emph{Inferred $\tage$}}:  
Figure~\ref{fig:etas} confirms that we derive unbiased and precise constraints
on $\tage$ out to $\tage < 8$ Gyr. 
For galaxies with older stellar populations above this limit, the log-spaced
$\tlb$ binning in our SPS model (Section~\ref{sec:sps}) expectedly results in
underestimated  $\tage$ constraints with larger uncertainties 
($\sigma_{\Delta_{\tage}} \gtrsim 1$ Gyr). 
Meanwhile, we find no significant SNR or color dependence in
Figure~\ref{fig:eta_photo}. 
At $r - z > 0.6$, $\tage$ appears to be underestimated, but this is just a
consequence of the correlation between $r-z$ and true $\tage$. 
The simulated galaxies with $r - z > 0.6$ in our sample have overall older
stellar populations. 
In Figure~\ref{fig:etas_msfr}, we do not find a clear $M_*-{\rm SFR}$
dependence. 
However, $|\mu_{\Delta_{\tage}}|$ is larger and constraints are significantly
less precise for galaxies below the so-called ``star-forming sequence'', which
generally have older stellar populations. \\

\noindent \underline{\emph{Inferred $\tauism$}}:  
Lastly, we find that both the accuracy and precision of our $\tauism$ depend
significant only the true $\tauism$ value. 
The inferred constraints increasingly underestimate $\tauism$ with lower
precision for greater $\tauism$.
The bias is primarily due to discrepancies between the dust prescriptiosn of
SPS model and the mock observations. 
First, we use a dust prescription with a different attenuation curve in the SPS
model than in the forward model. 
This places a strict limit on how accurately we can derive $\tauism$.
However, we intentially introduce this discrepancy since we do not know the 
``true'' attenuation curve of observed galaxies in practice so with the
discrepancy we test whether the {\sc PROVABGS} SPS model can marginalize the
effect of dust. 

Another reason for the biased $\tauism$ constraints is that we only attenuate
the stellar emission in the disk component of the simulated galaxies and not
the bulge component (Section~\ref{sec:sed}).
The true $\tauism$ is the optical depth for the disk componenet while our
$\tauism$ constraints correspond to the optical depth of dust attenuation
for the entire galaxies, a quantity that will be lower than the true $\tauism$
depending on how much the bulge contributes to the SED. 
Despite the discrepancies, we find no significant SNR or color dependence on
the accuracy and precision of $\tauism$ constraints
(Figure~\ref{fig:eta_photo}). 
Furthermore, we find unbiased and precise $\tauism$ constraints for all galaxies
except star-forming galaxies above $M_* > 10^{11}M_\odot$ where we underestimate 
$\tauism$. 
Massive star-forming galaxies in this regime mainly have $\tauism > 1$.
In Figure~\ref{fig:etas}, we present a more apples-to-apples comparison of the
$\tauism$ constraints, where we present $\eta_\Delta$ for only galaxies without
bulge contributions (black dotted). 
For these galaxies, the bias in our $\tauism$ constraints is reduced and
$\mu_{\Delta_\theta}<0.5$ throughout the $\tauism$ range. 
Our constraints are still biased, however, due to the discrepant attenuation
curves. 
We emphasize that the primary goal of dust prescription in our SPS model is to
marginalize out the effect of dust. 
Based on the accuracy and precision of our constraints on other galaxy
properties, the {\sc PROVABGS} SPS model achieves this object.  

%For $\avgsfr$, Figure~\ref{fig:etas_msfr} helps further characterize the effect
%of the SPS model prior on our constraints. 
%We expectedly find a significant bias for quiescent galaxies since our
%$\log\avgsfr$ constraints have a lower bound of $-1$ dex (Figure~\ref{fig:etas}).
%We also find that $\avgsfr$ is slightly underestimated for the most massive
%($M_* > 10^{11}M_\odot$) star-forming galaxies. 
%For the rest of the galaxies, there is no significant bias in the constraints. 
%In terms of precision, we find no significant $M_*-{\rm SFR}$ dependence in our
%$\log\avgsfr$ constraints. 


%The biases in $\avgsfr$, $Z_{\rm MW}$, $\tage$ are all a consequence of our SPS
%model priors (Appendix~\ref{sec:model_priors}). 
%$\avgsfr$, $Z_{\rm MW}$, and $\tage$ are derived quantities; hence, the uniform
%priors we impose on SPS parameters induce non-uniform priors on them.
%For our SPS model, we impose a prior on $\log \overline{\rm SSFR}_{\rm 1 Gyr}$
%that is skewed and peaks at ${\sim}-10.4$ dex (Figure~\ref{fig:model_priors}). 
%Consequently, the posterior overestimates $\avgsfr$ at low $\avgsfr$.
%The SPS model also imposes skewed priors on $\log Z_{\rm MW}$ and $\tage$,
%which causes to overestimate $\log Z_{\rm MW}$ for low $Z_{\rm MW}$ galaxies
%and underestimate $\tage$ for galaxies with older stellar population.

%which causes to overestimate $\log Z_{\rm MW}$ for low $Z_{\rm MW}$ galaxies
%and underestimate $\tage$ for galaxies with older stellar population. 



%As we mention earlier, the accuracy of our $Z_{\rm MW}$ constraint depends significantly on the spectral SNR ($r_{\rm fiber}$).
%meanwhile SFR is much sharper so it's more affected by the true galaxy properties This can then transition into the accuracy and precision as a function of galaxy type.

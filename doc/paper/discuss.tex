\section{Discussion} \label{sec:discuss}
\begin{itemize}
    \item restatement and discussion of robust galaxy property inference
    \item reiterate and discuss advantages of spectra+photometry that
        emphasizes why BGS will be awesome
    \item Beyond the galaxy properties we discuss in Section~\ref{sec:results},
        we can also derive SFH and ZH
    \item posterior over MAP
    \item model priors and preview of how we can correct for it
    \item caveats: flux calibration --- what was implemented versus what will
        need to be implemented in observations
    \item caveats: theoretical assumptions --- isochrones and stellar
        libraries, summary of the appendix
    \item despite the caveats, this work demonstrates that the galaxy
        properties inferred will be robust and awesome. Paragraph that mentions
        the extension of all the previous science applicatoins 
    \item paragraph that discusses the new science applications with the
        posteriors. 
\end{itemize}

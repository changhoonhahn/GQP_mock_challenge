\section{Discussion} \label{sec:discuss}
The most significant limitation of the {\sc PROVABGS} SED modeling in
inferring the true galaxy properties is the prior on galaxy properties imposed
by the model. 
The effect of such priors is  a major limitation for any SED modeling
methods~\citep{carnall2017, leja2019}. 
It is a consequence of the fact that galaxy properties are \emph{not}
parameters of the SPS model.
For instance, $\avgsfr$ and $\zmw$ are derived by integrating the SFH and ZH
(Eq.~\ref{eq:prop_eqs}), which are parameterized by $\beta_1, \beta_2, \beta_3,
\beta_4$ and $\gamma_1, \gamma_2$. 
Hence, uniform priors on $\beta$s and $\gamma$s (Section~\ref{sec:infer} and
Table~\ref{tab:params}) do not translate into uniform priors on $\avgsfr$ and
$\zmw$.
Other galaxy properties (\emph{e.g.}~$\tage$, SFH, and ZH) likewise have
non-uniform, and undesireable, priors. 

One way to address this issue  is to choose an SED model that does not impose
extreme priors on galaxy properties and characterize the priors in detail so
that final posteriors can be appropriately  interpreted. 
For our {\sc PROVABGS} model, we explicitly chose our SFH prescription so that
the prior on $\log\avgssfr$ extends the range $-12$ to $-9$ dex.
Furthermore, in Appendix~\ref{sec:model_priors} and
Figures~\ref{fig:model_priors} and~\ref{fig:sfh_prior}, we fully characterize
the prior on $\avgssfr$, $\zmw$, $\tage$, SFH, and ZH.
However, we can go beyond minimizing the impact of the priors and use
maximum-entropy 
With an estimate of the prior distribution, we can impose maximum-entropy
priors in a specified distribution~\citep{handley2019}. 
From an estimate of the prior distribution on the galaxy properties, we can
derive a new prior on the SPS model parameters that would impose uniform priors
on the galaxy properties. 
In Hahn in preparation, I will demonstrate that with this new prior, we can
infer posteriors on derived galaxy properties without being significantly
impacted by their prior. 
With this prior correction, we will be able to infer even more accurate
posteriors on the physical properties of galaxies with our {\sc PROVABGS} SED
modeling.

In this work, we use forward modeled mock observations to demonstrate that we
can infer accurate and precise posteriors on certain galaxy properties.
The mock observations are constructed from \lgal~and include photometry and
spectra. 
In generating the spectra, we model the fiber aperture effect --- \emph{i.e.}
spectra only include light from a galaxy collected within the DESI fiber
aperture --- by scaling the SED flux (Section~\ref{sec:spec}).
We account for this fiber aperture effect in the {\sc PROVABGS} SED model using 
a normalization factor, $f_{\rm fiber}$ (Section~\ref{sec:sps}). 
Hence, our mock observations and SED modeling have a consistent treatment of
the fiber aperture effect. 
In observations, however, fiber aperture effects can be wavelength dependent
(\todo{relevant citation}). 
For spectra affected by strongly wavelength dependent fiber aperture effects,
an overall $f_{\rm fiber}$ factor would not be sufficient.
In order to estimate the wavelength dependence of the fiber aperture
effect, we compare the ratio of the predicted fiber flux over flux from LS
photometry in  $g$, $r$, $z$ bands. 
Fiber flux is the predicted photometric flux within a fiber of diameter 1.5''
so the ratio estimates the fiber aperture effect for a specific photometric band. 
Based on the comparison with LS photometry, we find little wavelength
dependence in the fiber aperture effect. \todo{something more concrete after I
redo the comparison}

In addition to the fiber aperture effect, flux calibration performed on DESI
spectra can also induce wavelength dependent residuals. 
DESI spectra is measured using three-arm spectrographs that split the spectra
into three $b$, $r$, and $z$ channels with overlapping wavelength ranges: 
$3600 - 5930$, $5660 - 7720$, and $7470 - 9800 \AA$.  
After sky subtraction, flux calibration is performed on each channel of the
spectra by matching physical stellar models to spectra of spectrohotometric
standard stars observed in the same exposure. 
Since the calibration is performed for each channel seaparately, imperfections
can imprint a wavelength dependent residual. 
However, in \todo{some concrete statement about how well flux calibration works
from SV paper}.
%Despite the overall excellent performance of DESI flux calibration, 
In Ramos \etal~(in preparation), we examine the fiber aperture effect and
wavelength dependent imprints on DESI spectra using BGS spectra from the DESI
Survey Validataion data and MaNGA observations. 
\todo{some statement about how we will devise a correction or marginalization
accordingly}. 
We note that the {\sc PROVABGS} SED modeling pipline already includes flux
calibration models beyond a single $f_{\rm fiber}$ and can easily be extended
to include more sophisticated models~\citep[\emph{e.g.} Chebyschev
polynomial][]{carnall2017, tacchella2021}. 

\todo{paragraph on how we handle theoretical assumptions --- isochrones and
stellar libraries, summary of the appendix}

\todo{Nevertheless,} we demonstrate with the mock challenge that we can derive
accurate and precise constraints on specific galaxy properties using the {\sc
PROVABGS} SED modeling. 
The {\sc PROVABGS} catalog will have a number of key advantages over other
value-added galaxy catalogs. 
First, {\sc PROVABGS} will provide full Bayesian posteriors on galaxy
properties intead of ``best-fit'' point estimates from maximizing the
likelihood. 
Posterior distributions are essential for accurately estimating uncertainties
on galaxy properties.  
As we find earlier, these uncertainties are significant, especially for
properties such as $\zmw$ (Figure~\ref{fig:prop_inf}), and ignoring them
overestimates the statistical precision of the derived galaxy proprties. 

Furthermore, the {\sc PROVABGS} posteriors will be derived from MCMC sampling
rather than grid-based methods often used in the
past~\citep[\emph{e.g.}][]{dacunha2008, moustakas2013, boquien2019}.
As a result, they can accurately estimate posterior distributions with
significant parameter degeneracies or multiple modes (peaks). 
For instance, in the posterior of Figure~\ref{fig:posterior} we find
degeneracies between $f_{\rm burst}$ and $\{\beta_1, \beta_2, \beta_3,
\beta_4\}$ and between $\{\gamma_1, \gamma_2\}$ and $\{\beta_1, \beta_2,
\beta_3, \beta_4\}$; the posterior is also multi-modal. 
Accurately posteriors are especially important in order to use maximum-entropy
proirs to correct for the model priors on galaxy properties discussed earlier. 
Also, grid-based methods scale exponentially with the number of SPS parameters
so they quickly become infeasible as the dimensionality of SPS models increase.  
Meanwhile, MCMC scales approximately linearly with the number of parameters.

%\todo{Beyond the galaxy properties we discuss in Section~\ref{sec:results}, we can also derive SFH and ZH}
In this work, we primarily focus on the following physical properties of
galaxies: $\log M_*$, $\log\avgsfr$, $\log\zmw$, $\tage$, and $\tauism$. 
The {\sc PROVABGS} SPS model, however, can constrain galaxy properties beyond
these properties. 
The SPS model employs nonparametric SFH and ZH prescriptions based on NMF bases
and the model parameters include coefficients for these bases. 
Posteriors on the SPS model parameters, thus, can be used to derive constraints
on the SFH and ZH. 
In Figure~\ref{fig:sfh_demo}, we present the inferred SFH and ZH of two
simulated galaxies from our \lgal~sample: a star-forming galaxy (blue) and a
quiescent galaxy (orange). 
We mark the 68 and 95\% confidence intervals in the shaded regions. 
For comparison, we include the true SFH and ZH from \lgal~(dashed).  
The inferred SFH and ZH is able to generally recover the true histories. 
We emphasize that current SPS models assume constant ZHs that does not vary
over time~\citep{carnall2017, leja2019}. 
Hence inferring ZH over time is one of the key advantages of our {\sc PROVABGS}
SPS model. 
Similar to the inferred $\avgsfr$ and $\zmw$, the SFH and ZH constraints are
also impacted by the priors imposed by our SPS model. 
We charaterize the impact of the prior in detail in
Appendix~\ref{sec:model_priors}.

Another key advantage of {\sc PROVABGS} is that it will infer galaxy
properties from joint SED modeling of photometry \emph{and spectra}. 
Our results illustrate the advantages of including spectra in SED modeling. 
Galaxy spectra provide substantial statistical power for constraining galaxy
galaxy properties. 
In addition to overall tightening the constraints, the statistical power of
galaxy spectra is essential for mitigating the effect of the model priors. 
For instance, including spectra in the SED modeling significantly reduces the
bias of our $\zmw$ and $\tage$ constraints (Figure~\ref{fig:etas}). 
It also reduces the lower bound on the inferred $\avgsfr$. 
In fact, without spectra, we are dominated by priors on $\avgsfr$ and cannot
robustly infer galaxy properties of quiescent galaxies with $\log\avgsfr > 0$
dex.
%We emphasize that all of these benefits come from spectra with the SNR of BGS, which is observing during bright time. 

With over $10$ million DESI BGS galaxy spectra, {\sc PROVABGS} will provide a
value-added galaxy catalog with unprecedented statistical power.

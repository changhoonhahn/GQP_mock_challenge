\section{Undesirable priors imposed on SFR} \label{sec:sfr_priors}
The input chain are samples drawn from the inferred posteriors for our
parameters: M*, b1, b2, b3, b4, g1, g2, etc. Regardless of whether we 
use a Dirichlet or Uniform priors for b1, b2, b3, b4 (the SFH basis
coefficients), we impose an undesirable prior on SSFR. We correct for
this using importance weighting with weights derived from maximum
entropy prior correction of Handley & Millea (2019).

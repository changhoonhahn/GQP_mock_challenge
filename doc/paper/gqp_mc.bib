  abstract = {This paper describes the Seventh Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), marking the completion of the original goals of the SDSS and the end of the phase known as SDSS-II. It includes 11,663 deg2 of imaging data, with most of the \textasciitilde 2000 deg2 increment over the previous data release lying in regions of low Galactic latitude. The catalog contains five-band photometry for 357 million distinct objects. The survey also includes repeat photometry on a 120\textdegree{} long, 2fdg5 wide stripe along the celestial equator in the Southern Galactic Cap, with some regions covered by as many as 90 individual imaging runs. We include a co-addition of the best of these data, going roughly 2 mag fainter than the main survey over 250 deg2. The survey has completed spectroscopy over 9380 deg2 the spectroscopy is now complete over a large contiguous area of the Northern Galactic Cap, closing the gap that was present in previous data releases. There are over 1.6 million spectra in total, including 930,000 galaxies, 120,000 quasars, and 460,000 stars. The data release includes improved stellar photometry at low Galactic latitude. The astrometry has all been recalibrated with the second version of the USNO CCD Astrograph Catalog, reducing the rms statistical errors at the bright end to 45 milliarcseconds per coordinate. We further quantify a systematic error in bright galaxy photometry due to poor sky determination; this problem is less severe than previously reported for the majority of galaxies. Finally, we describe a series of improvements to the spectroscopic reductions, including better flat fielding and improved wavelength calibration at the blue end, better processing of objects with extremely strong narrow emission lines, and an improved determination of stellar metallicities.},

  abstract = {We use the technique of total satellite luminosity, Lsat, to probe the dark matter haloes around active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the SDSS Main Galaxy Sample. Our results focus on galaxies and AGNs that are the central galaxy of their halo. Our two AGN samples are constructed from optical emission-line diagnostics and from Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) infrared colours. Both optically selected and WISE-selected AGN have Lsat values twice as high as non-active galaxy samples when controlling for stellar mass and mean stellar age. This implies that the haloes are twice as massive, but we cannot rule out that the increase in Lsat is due to these AGNs residing in younger haloes at the same mass. When only controlling for host galaxy stellar mass, WISE-selected AGNs also have higher Lsat values than optical AGNs at the factor of two level, consistent with previous results comparing the clustering of obscured and unobscured AGNs. However, controlling for stellar age in the two populations of host galaxies removes half of this difference, attenuating the statistical significance of the difference. We perform permutation tests to quantify the difference in the halo populations of each sample. The difference in star formation properties does not fully explain the difference in the two AGN populations, however. Although AGN luminosity correlates with mean stellar age, the difference in stellar age between the WISE and optical samples cannot be fully explained by differences in their AGN luminosity distributions.},

  abstract = {We present \textbackslash textsc\{speculator\} -- a fast, accurate, and flexible framework for emulating stellar population synthesis (SPS) models for predicting galaxy spectra and photometry. For emulating spectra, we use principal component analysis to construct a set of basis functions, and neural networks to learn the basis coefficients as a function of the SPS model parameters. For photometry, we parameterize the magnitudes (for the filters of interest) as a function of SPS parameters by a neural network. The resulting emulators are able to predict spectra and photometry under both simple and complicated SPS model parameterizations to percent-level accuracy, giving a factor of \$10\^3\$--\$10\^4\$ speed up over direct SPS computation. They have readily-computable derivatives, making them amenable to gradient-based inference and optimization methods. The emulators are also straightforward to call from a GPU, giving an additional order-of-magnitude speed-up. Rapid SPS computations delivered by emulation offers a massive reduction in the computational resources required to infer the physical properties of galaxies from observed spectra or photometry and simulate galaxy populations under SPS models, whilst maintaining the accuracy required for a range of applications.},

DR3 consists of: the first release of data covering the G02 region and of data on H-ATLAS (Herschel - Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey) sources in the equatorial regions; and updates to data on sources released in DR2. DR3 includes 154 809 sources with secure redshifts across four regions. A subset of the G02 region is 95.5 per cent redshift complete to r {$<$} 19.8 mag over an area of 19.5 deg2, with 20 086 galaxy redshifts, that overlaps substantially with the XXL survey (X-ray) and VIPERS (redshift survey). In the equatorial regions, the main survey has even higher completeness (98.5 per cent), and spectra for about 75 per cent of H-ATLAS filler targets were also obtained. This filler sample extends spectroscopic redshifts, for probable optical counterparts to H-ATLAS submillimetre sources, to 0.8 mag deeper (r {$<$} 20.6 mag) than the GAMA main survey. There are 25 814 galaxy redshifts for H-ATLAS sources from the GAMA main or filler surveys. GAMA DR3 is available at the survey website (www.gama-survey.org/dr3/).},

The degree of relativistic broadening indicates a preference for high black hole spin, but the reflection is weaker than that expected for a flat disc illuminated by a point source. We investigate the Compton reflection signatures as a function of luminosity, redshift, and obscuration, confirming an X-ray Baldwin effect for both the narrow and broad components of the iron line. Anticorrelations are also seen with redshift and obscuring column density, but are difficult to disentangle from the Baldwin effect. Our methodology is able to extract information from multiple spectra with low signal-to-noise ratio (SN), and can be applied to future data sets such as eROSITA. We show using simulations, however, that it is necessary to apply an appropriate S/N cut to the samples to ensure the spectra add useful information.},

Key findings include: galaxy assembly correlates strongly with halo assembly; quenching correlates strongly with halo mass; quenched fractions at fixed halo mass decrease with increasing redshift; massive quenched galaxies reside in higher-mass haloes than star-forming galaxies at fixed galaxy mass; star-forming and quenched galaxies' star formation histories at fixed mass differ most at z \&lt; 0.5; satellites have large scatter in quenching timescales after infall, and have modestly higher quenched fractions than central galaxies; Planck cosmologies result in up to 0.3 dex lower stellar\textemdash halo mass ratios at early times; and, nonetheless, stellar mass-halo mass ratios rise at z \&gt; 5.

In addition, we present the dependence of local galaxy density (smoothed on 8 h-1 Mpc scales) on all of these properties. Several classic, well-known relations among galaxy properties are evident at extremely high signal-to-noise ratio: the color-color relations of galaxies, the color-magnitude relations, the magnitude-surface brightness relation, and the dependence of density on color and absolute magnitude. We show that most of the i-band luminosity density in the universe is in the absolute magnitude and surface brightness ranges used: -23.50.1i{$<$}-17.0 mag and 17{$<\mu$}0.1i{$<$}24 mag in 1 arcsec2 [the notation zb represents the b band shifted blueward by a factor (1+z)]. Some of the relationships between parameters, in particular the color-magnitude relations, show stronger correlations for exponential galaxies and concentrated galaxies taken separately than for all galaxies taken together. We provide a simple set of fits of the dependence of galaxy properties on luminosity for these two sets of galaxies and other quantitative details of our results.

The photometric catalog consists of 693,319 galaxies, QSOs, and stars; 343,568 of these have redshift determinations, mostly from the SDSS. Excluding areas masked by bright stars, the photometric sample covers 3514 deg2, and the spectroscopic sample covers 2627 deg2 (with about 85\% completeness). Earlier, proprietary versions of this catalog have formed the basis of many SDSS investigations of the power spectrum, correlation function, and luminosity function of galaxies. Future releases will follow future public releases of the SDSS. The catalog includes matches to the Two Micron All Sky Survey Point Source Catalog and Extended Source Catalog, the IRAS Point Source Catalog Redshift Survey, the Two-Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey, the Third Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies, and the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty cm survey. We calculate and compile derived quantities from the images and spectra of the galaxies in the catalogs (for example, K-corrections and structural parameters for the galaxies). The SDSS catalog presented here is photometrically calibrated in a more consistent way than that distributed by the SDSS Data Release 2 Archive Servers and is thus more appropriate for large-scale structure statistics, reducing systematic calibration errors across the sky from \textasciitilde 2\% to \textasciitilde 1\%. We include an explicit description of the geometry of the catalog, including all imaging and targeting information as a function of sky position. Finally, we have performed eyeball quality checks on a large number of objects in the catalog in order to flag errors (such as errors in deblending). This catalog is complementary to the SDSS Archive Servers in that NYU-VAGC's calibration, geometric description, and conveniently small size are specifically designed for studying galaxy properties and large-scale structure statistics using the SDSS spectroscopic catalog.

  abstract = {Context. Measuring how the physical properties of galaxies change across cosmic times is essential to understand galaxy formation and evolution. With the advent of numerous ground-based and space-borne instruments launched over the past few decades we now have exquisite multi-wavelength observations of galaxies from the far-ultraviolet (FUV) to the radio domain. To tap into this mine of data and obtain new insight into the formation and evolution of galaxies, it is essential that we are able to extract information from their spectral energy distribution (SED). {$<$}BR /{$>$} Aims: We present a completely new implementation of Code Investigating GALaxy Emission (CIGALE). Written in python, its main aims are to easily and efficiently model the FUV to radio spectrum of galaxies and estimate their physical properties such as star formation rate, attenuation, dust luminosity, stellar mass, and many other physical quantities. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: To compute the spectral models, CIGALE builds composite stellar populations from simple stellar populations combined with highly flexible star formation histories, calculates the emission from gas ionised by massive stars, and attenuates both the stars and the ionised gas with a highly flexible attenuation curve. Based on an energy balance principle, the absorbed energy is then re-emitted by the dust in the mid- and far-infrared domains while thermal and non-thermal components are also included, extending the spectrum far into the radio range. A large grid of models is then fitted to the data and the physical properties are estimated through the analysis of the likelihood distribution. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: CIGALE is a versatile and easy-to-use tool that makes full use of the architecture of multi-core computers, building grids of millions of models and analysing samples of thousands of galaxies, both at high speed. Beyond fitting the SEDs of galaxies and parameter estimations, it can also be used as a model-generation tool or serve as a library to build new applications. {$<$}P /{$>$}A copy of the code is only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {$<$}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/"{$>$}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{$<$}/A{$>$} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {$<$}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/622/A103"{$>$}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/622/A103{$<$}/A{$>$}},

The MS-II assumes the same cosmological parameters and uses the same particle number and output data structure as the original Millennium Simulation (MS), but was carried out in a periodic cube one-fifth the size (100h-1Mpc) with five times better spatial resolution (a Plummer equivalent softening of 1.0h-1kpc) and with 125 times better mass resolution (a particle mass of 6.9 \texttimes{} 106h-1Msolar). By comparing results at MS and MS-II resolution, we demonstrate excellent convergence in dark matter statistics such as the halo mass function, the subhalo abundance distribution, the mass dependence of halo formation times, the linear and non-linear autocorrelations and power spectra, and halo assembly bias. Together, the two simulations provide precise results for such statistics over an unprecedented range of scales, from haloes similar to those hosting Local Group dwarf spheroidal galaxies to haloes corresponding to the richest galaxy clusters. The `Milky Way' haloes of the Aquarius Project were selected from a lower resolution version of the MS-II and were then resimulated at much higher resolution. As a result, they are present in the MS-II along with thousands of other similar mass haloes. A comparison of their assembly histories in the MS-II and in resimulations of 1000 times better resolution shows detailed agreement over a factor of 100 in mass growth. We publicly release halo catalogues and assembly trees for the MS-II in the same format within the same archive as those already released for the MS.},

By comparing physical information extracted from the emission lines with continuum properties, we build up a picture of the nature of star-forming galaxies at z {$<$} 0.2. We develop a method for aperture correction using resolved imaging and show that our method takes out essentially all aperture bias in the star formation rate (SFR) estimates, allowing an accurate estimate of the total SFRs in galaxies. We determine the SFR density to be 1.915+0.02-0.01 (random)+0.14-0.42 (systematic) h7010-2 Msolar yr-1 Mpc-3 at z= 0.1 (for a Kroupa initial mass function) and we study the distribution of star formation as a function of various physical parameters. The majority of the star formation in the low-redshift Universe takes place in moderately massive galaxies (1010-1011 Msolar), typically in high surface brightness disc galaxies. Roughly 15 per cent of all star formation takes place in galaxies that show some sign of an active nucleus. About 20 per cent occurs in starburst galaxies. By focusing on the SFR per unit mass we show that the present to past average SFR, the Scalo b-parameter, is almost constant over almost three orders of magnitude in mass, declining only at M* {$>$} 1010 Msolar. The volume averaged b parameter is 0.408+0.005-0.002 (random)+0.029-0.090 (systematic)h-170. We use this value to constrain the star formation history of the Universe. For the concordance cosmology the present-day Universe is forming stars at at least 1/3 of its past average rate. For an exponentially declining cosmic star formation history this corresponds to a time-scale of 7+0.7-1.5 Gyr. In agreement with other work we find a correlation between b and morphological type, as well as a tight correlation between the 4000-\AA break (D4000) and b. We discuss how D4000 can be used to estimate b parameters for high-redshift galaxies.},

The implications of these results for high redshift galaxies are discussed. Arguments can be given to support the view that Local starbursts are representative of high-redshift (z{$>$}2), UV-detected, star-forming galaxies. If this is the case, the high redshift FIR emission will be generally undetected in sub-mm surveys, unless (1) the bolometric luminosity of the high-z galaxies is comparable to or larger than that of Local ultraluminous FIR galaxies and (2) their FIR SED contains a cool dust component.},

We define this stochastic process through a power spectrum density with a functional form of a broken power-law. Star-formation histories are correlated on short timescales, the strength of this correlation described by a power-law slope, \$\textbackslash alpha\$, and they decorrelate to resemble white noise over a timescale that is proportional to the timescale of the break in the power spectrum density, \$\textbackslash tau\_\{\textbackslash rm break\}\$. We use this framework to explore the properties of the stochastic process that, we assume, gives rise to the log-normal scatter about the relationship between star-formation rate and stellar mass, the so-called galaxy star-forming main sequence. Specifically, we show how the measurements of the normalisation and width (\$\textbackslash sigma\_\{\textbackslash rm MS\}\$) of the main sequence, measured in several passbands that probe different timescales, give a constraint on the parameters of the underlying power spectrum density. We first derive these results analytically for a simplified case where we model observations by averaging over the recent star-formation history. We then run numerical simulations to find results for more realistic observational cases. As a proof of concept, we use observational estimates of the main sequence scatter at \$z\textbackslash sim0\$ and \$M\_\{\textbackslash star\}\textbackslash approx10\^\{10\}\textasciitilde M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ measured in H\$\textbackslash alpha\$, UV+IR and the u-band, and show that combination of these point to \$\textbackslash tau\_\{\textbackslash rm break\}=178\^\{+104\}\_\{-66\}\$ Myr, when assuming \$\textbackslash alpha=2\$. This implies that star-formation histories of galaxies lose "memory" of their previous activity on a timescale of \$\textbackslash sim200\$ Myr, highlighting the importance of baryonic effects that act over the dynamical timescales of galaxies.},

We extensively test our ability to recover realistic star-formation histories (SFHs) with BAGPIPES by fitting mock observations of quiescent galaxies from the MUFASA simulation. We show that a double-power-law model produces better agreement with realistic SFHs than an exponentially-declining model. We then perform a detailed analysis of the SFHs of a sample of 9312 quiescent galaxies from UltraVISTA with stellar masses, \$M\_* {$>$} 10\^\{10\}\textbackslash{} \textbackslash mathrm\{M\_\textbackslash odot\}\$ and redshifts \$0.25 {$<$} z\_\textbackslash mathrm\{obs\} {$<$} 3.75\$. The majority of our quiescent sample exhibit SFHs which rise gradually then quench relatively rapidly, over \$\textbackslash sim 1\{-\}2\$ Gyr. This behaviour is consistent with recent cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, where AGN-driven feedback in the low-accretion (jet) mode is the dominant quenching mechanism. In addition, we identify two further subsets of objects with distinct SFH shapes. At \$z\_\textbackslash mathrm\{obs\} \textbackslash gtrsim 1\$ we find a class of objects with SFHs which rise and fall very rapidly, with quenching timescales of \$\textbackslash lesssim 1\$ Gyr. These objects are consistent with (potentially merger-triggered) quasar-mode AGN feedback. Also, at \$z\_\textbackslash mathrm\{obs\} \textbackslash lesssim 1\$ we find a population with SFHs which quench more slowly than they rise, over \$\textbackslash gtrsim3\$ Gyr, which we speculate to be the result of a 'natural' quenching process, where galaxy SFHs die down gradually due to the diminishing overall cosmic gas supply. Purely passive evolution of the quiescent population at \$z\_\textbackslash mathrm\{obs\} \textbackslash gtrsim 0.5\$ is disfavoured by our results.},

  abstract = {Parametric models for galaxy star-formation histories (SFHs) are widely used, though they are known to impose strong priors on physical parameters. This has consequences for measurements of the galaxy stellar-mass function (GSMF), star-formation-rate density (SFRD) and star-forming main sequence (SFMS). We investigate the effects of the exponentially declining, delayed exponentially declining, lognormal and double power law SFH models using BAGPIPES. We demonstrate that each of these models imposes strong priors on specific star-formation rates (sSFRs), potentially biasing the SFMS, and also imposes a strong prior preference for young stellar populations. We show that stellar mass, SFR and mass-weighted age inferences from high-quality mock photometry vary with the choice of SFH model by at least 0.1, 0.3 and 0.2 dex respectively. However the biases with respect to the true values depend more on the true SFH shape than the choice of model. We also demonstrate that photometric data cannot discriminate between SFH models, meaning it is important to perform independent tests to find well-motivated priors. We finally fit a low-redshift, volume-complete sample of galaxies from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) Survey with each model. We demonstrate that our stellar masses and SFRs at redshift, \$z\textbackslash sim0.05\$ are consistent with other analyses. However, our inferred cosmic SFRDs peak at \$z\textbackslash sim0.4\$, approximately 6 Gyr later than direct observations suggest, meaning our mass-weighted ages are significantly underestimated. This makes the use of parametric SFH models for understanding mass assembly in galaxies challenging. In a companion paper we consider non-parametric SFH models.},

  abstract = {We review recent determinations of the present-day mass function (PDMF) and initial mass function (IMF) in various components of the Galaxy-disk, spheroid, young, and globular clusters-and in conditions characteristic of early star formation. As a general feature, the IMF is found to depend weakly on the environment and to be well described by a power-law form for m{$>\sptilde$}1 Msolar and a lognormal form below, except possibly for early star formation conditions. The disk IMF for single objects has a characteristic mass around mc\textasciitilde 0.08 Msolar and a variance in logarithmic mass {$\sigma\sptilde$}0.7, whereas the IMF for multiple systems has mc\textasciitilde 0.2 Msolar and {$\sigma\sptilde$}0.6. The extension of the single MF into the brown dwarf regime is in good agreement with present estimates of L- and T-dwarf densities and yields a disk brown dwarf number density comparable to the stellar one, nBD\textasciitilde n*\textasciitilde 0.1 pc-3. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries, confirming the fact that young star clusters and disk field stars represent the same stellar population. Dynamical effects, yielding depletion of the lowest mass objects, are found to become consequential for ages {$>\sptilde$}130 Myr. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust grounds. The large metallicity spread in the local subdwarf photometric sample, in particular, remains puzzling. Recent observations suggest that there is a continuous kinematic shear between the thick-disk population, present in local samples, and the genuine spheroid one. This enables us to derive only an upper limit for the spheroid mass density and IMF. Within all the uncertainties, the latter is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk, mc\textasciitilde 0.2-0.3 Msolar, excluding a significant population of brown dwarfs in globular clusters and in the spheroid. The IMF characteristic of early star formation at large redshift remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below \textasciitilde 1 Msolar. These results suggest a characteristic mass for star formation that decreases with time, from conditions prevailing at large redshift to conditions characteristic of the spheroid (or thick disk) to present-day conditions. These conclusions, however, remain speculative, given the large uncertainties in the spheroid and early star IMF determinations. These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications beyond the Milky Way in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The mass-to-light ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8-1.4 times smaller than for a Salpeter IMF, respectively, in agreement with various recent dynamical determinations. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. None of the theories based on a Jeans-type mechanism, where fragmentation is due only to gravity, can fulfill all the observational constraints on star formation and predict a large number of substellar objects. On the other hand, recent numerical simulations of compressible turbulence, in particular in super-Alfv\'enic conditions, seem to reproduce both qualitatively and quantitatively the stellar and substellar IMF and thus provide an appealing theoretical foundation. In this picture, star formation is induced by the dissipation of large-scale turbulence to smaller scales through radiative MHD shocks, producing filamentary structures. These shocks produce local nonequilibrium structures with large density contrasts, which collapse eventually in gravitationally bound objects under the combined influence of turbulence and gravity. The concept of a single Jeans mass is replaced by a distribution of local Jeans masses, representative of the lognormal probability density function of the turbulent gas. Objects below the mean thermal Jeans mass still have a possibility to collapse, although with a decreasing probability.

The model includes the ionization of H II regions in the interiors of the dense clouds in which stars form and the influence of the finite lifetime of these clouds on the absorption of radiation. We compute the production of emission lines and the absorption of continuum radiation in the H II regions and the subsequent transfer of line and continuum radiation in the surrounding H I regions and the ambient ISM. This enables us to interpret simultaneously all the observations of an ultraviolet-selected sample of nearby starburst galaxies, including the ratio of far-infrared to ultraviolet luminosities, the ratio of H{$\alpha$} to H{$\beta$} luminosities, the H{$\alpha$} equivalent width, and the ultraviolet spectral slope. We show that the finite lifetime of stellar birth clouds is a key ingredient for resolving an apparent discrepancy between the attenuation of line and continuum photons in starburst galaxies. In addition, we find that an effective absorption curve proportional to {$\lambda$}-0.7 reproduces the observed relation between the ratio of far-infrared to ultraviolet luminosities and the ultraviolet spectral slope. We interpret this relation most simply as a sequence in the overall dust content of the galaxies. The shallow wavelength dependence of the effective absorption curve is compatible with the steepness of known extinction curves if the dust has a patchy distribution. In particular, we find that a random distribution of discrete clouds with optical depths similar to those in the Milky Way provides a consistent interpretation of all the observations. A noteworthy outcome of our detailed analysis is that the observed mean relations for starburst galaxies can be closely approximated by the following simple recipe: use an effective absorption curve proportional to {$\lambda$}-0.7 to attenuate the line and continuum radiation from each stellar generation, and lower the normalization of the curve, typically by a factor of 3 after 107 yr, to account for the dispersal of the birth clouds. This recipe or our full model for absorption can be incorporated easily into any population synthesis model.},

Using GALAXPY, a new galaxy spectral prediction tool, and SFHs predicted by the empirical model UNIVERSEMACHINE and the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG, we isolate the influence of SFH on optical and near-infrared colours from 320 to 1080 \AA{} at z = 0. By carrying out a principal component analysis, we show that physically motivated SFH variations modify galaxy colours along a single direction in colour space: the SFH-direction. We find that the projection of a galaxy's present-day colours on to the SFH-direction is almost completely regulated by the fraction of stellar mass that the galaxy formed over the last billion years. Together with cosmic downsizing, this results in galaxies becoming redder as their host halo mass increases. We additionally study the change in galaxy colours due to variations in metallicity, dust attenuation, and nebular emission lines, finding that these properties vary broad-band colours along distinct directions in colour space relative to the SFH-direction. Finally, we show that the colours of low-redshift Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxies span an ellipsoid with significant extent along two independent dimensions, and that the SFH-direction is well-aligned with the major axis of this ellipsoid. Our analysis supports the conclusion that variations in SFH are the dominant influence on present-day galaxy colours, and that the nature of this influence is strikingly simple.},

  abstract = {Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and its extensions such as Nonnegative Tensor Factorization (NTF) have become prominent techniques for blind sources separation (BSS), analysis of image databases, data mining and other information retrieval and clustering applications. In this paper we propose a family of efficient algorithms for NMF/NTF, as well as sparse nonnegative coding and representation, that has many potential applications in computational neuroscience, multi-sensory processing, compressed sensing and multidimensional data analysis. We have developed a class of optimized local algorithms which are referred to as Hierarchical Alternating Least Squares (HALS) algorithms. For these purposes, we have performed sequential constrained minimization on a set of squared Euclidean distances. We then extend this approach to robust cost functions using the alpha and beta divergences and derive flexible update rules. Our algorithms are locally stable and work well for NMF-based blind source separation (BSS) not only for the over-determined case but also for an under-determined (over-complete) case (i.e., for a system which has less sensors than sources) if data are sufficiently sparse. The NMF learning rules are extended and generalized for N-th order nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF).

  abstract = {The star-formation history (SFH) of galaxies is a key assumption to derive their physical properties and can lead to strong biases. In this work, we derive the SFH of main sequence (MS) galaxies and show how the peak SFH of a galaxy depends on its seed mass at, for example, z = 5. This seed mass reflects the galaxy's underlying dark matter (DM) halo environment. We show that, following the MS, galaxies undergo a drastic slow down of their stellar mass growth after reaching the peak of their SFH. According to abundance matching, these masses correspond to hot and massive DM halos which state could result in less efficient gas inflows on the galaxies and thus could be the origin of limited stellar mass growth. As a result, we show that galaxies, still on the MS, can enter the passive region of the UVJ diagram while still forming stars. The best fit to the MS SFH is provided by a right skew peak function for which we provide parameters depending on the seed mass of the galaxy. The ability of the classical analytical SFHs to retrieve the star-formation rate (SFR) of galaxies from spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting is studied. Due to mathematical limitations, the exponentially declining and delayed SFH struggle to model high SFR, which starts to be problematic at z \&gt; 2. The exponentially rising and log-normal SFHs exhibit the opposite behavior with the ability to reach very high SFR, and thus model starburst galaxies, but they are not able to model low values such as those expected at low redshift for massive galaxies. By simulating galaxies SED from the MS SFH, we show that these four analytical forms recover the SFR of MS galaxies with an error dependent on the model and the redshift. They are, however, sensitive enough to probe small variations of SFR within the MS, with an error ranging from 5 to 40\% depending on the SFH assumption and redshift; but all the four fail to recover the SFR of rapidly quenched galaxies. However, these SFHs lead to an artificial gradient of age, parallel to the MS, which is not exhibited by the simulated sample. This gradient is also produced on real data as we show using a sample of real galaxies with redshifts between 1.5 and 2.5. Here, we propose an SFH composed of a delayed form to model the bulk of stellar population with the addition of a flexibility in the recent SFH. This SFH provides very good estimates of the SFR of MS, starbursts, and rapidly quenched galaxies at all redshift. Furthermore, when used on the real sample, the age gradient disappears which show its dependency on the SFH assumption made to perform the SED fitting.},

SPS relies on stellar evolution calculations from the main sequence to stellar death, stellar spectral libraries, phenomenological dust models, and stellar initial mass functions (IMFs). The present work is the first in a series that explores the impact of uncertainties in key phases of stellar evolution and the IMF on the derived physical properties of galaxies and the expected luminosity evolution for a passively evolving set of stars. A Monte-Carlo Markov-Chain approach is taken to fit near-UV through near-IR photometry of a representative sample of low- and high-redshift galaxies with this new SPS model. Significant results include the following: 1) including uncertainties in stellar evolution, stellar masses at z\textasciitilde 0 carry errors of \textasciitilde 0.3 dex at 95\% CL with little dependence on luminosity or color, while at z\textasciitilde 2, the masses of bright red galaxies are uncertain at the \textasciitilde 0.6 dex level; 2) either current stellar evolution models, current observational stellar libraries, or both, do not adequately characterize the metallicity-dependence of the thermally-pulsating asymptotic giant branch phase; 3) conservative estimates on the uncertainty of the slope of the IMF in the solar neighborhood imply that luminosity evolution per unit redshift is uncertain at the \textasciitilde 0.4 mag level in the K-band, which is a substantial source of uncertainty for interpreting the evolution of galaxy populations across time; 4) The more plausible assumption of a distribution of stellar metallicities, rather than a fixed value as is usually assumed, can have significant effects on the interpretation of colors blueward of the V-band.

  abstract = {Stellar population synthesis (SPS) provides the link between the stellar and dust content of galaxies and their observed spectral energy distributions. In the present work, we perform a comprehensive calibration of our own flexible SPS (FSPS) model against a suite of data. These data include ultraviolet, optical, and near-IR photometry, surface brightness fluctuations, and integrated spectra of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs), M87, M31, and the Milky Way (MW), and photometry and spectral indices of both quiescent and post-starburst galaxies at z \textasciitilde{} 0. Several public SPS models are intercompared, including the models of Bruzual \& Charlot (BC03), Maraston (M05), and FSPS. The relative strengths and weaknesses of these models are evaluated, with the following conclusions: (1) the FSPS and BC03 models compare favorably with MC data at all ages, whereas M05 colors are too red and the age dependence is incorrect; (2) all models yield similar optical and near-IR colors for old metal-poor systems, and yet they all provide poor fits to the integrated J - K and V - K colors of both MW and M31 star clusters; (3) FSPS is able to fit all of the ultraviolet data because both the post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) and horizontal branch evolutionary phases are handled flexibly, while the BC03 and M05 models fail in the far-UV, and both far- and near-UV, respectively; (4) all models predict ugr colors too red, D n 4000 strengths too strong, and H{$\delta$} A strengths too weak compared to massive red sequence galaxies, under the assumption that such galaxies are composed solely of old metal-rich stars; and (5) FSPS and, to a lesser extent, BC03 can reproduce the optical and near-IR colors of post-starburst galaxies, while M05 cannot. Reasons for these discrepancies are explored. The failure at predicting the ugr colors, D n 4000, and H{$\delta$} A strengths can be explained by some combination of a minority population of metal-poor stars, young stars, blue straggler and/or blue horizontal branch (HB) stars, but not by appealing to inadequacies in either theoretical stellar atmospheres or canonical evolutionary phases (e.g., the main-sequence turnoff). The different model predictions in the near-IR for intermediate age systems are due to different treatments of the thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch stellar evolutionary phase. We emphasize that due to a lack of calibrating star cluster data in regions of the metallicity-age plane relevant for galaxies, all of these models continue to suffer from serious uncertainties that are difficult to quantify.},

  abstract = {We present a simple, largely empirical but physically motivated model to  interpret the mid- and far-infrared spectral energy distributions of galaxies consistently with the emission at ultraviolet, optical and near-infrared wavelengths. Our model relies on an existing angle-averaged prescription to compute the absorption of starlight by dust in stellar birth clouds and in the ambient interstellar medium (ISM) in galaxies. We compute the spectral energy distribution of the power reradiated by dust in stellar birth clouds as the sum of three components: a component of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs); a mid-infrared continuum characterizing the emission from hot grains at temperatures in the range 130-250 K; and a component of grains in thermal equilibrium with adjustable temperature in the range 30-60 K. In the ambient ISM, we fix for simplicity the relative proportions of these three components to reproduce the spectral shape of diffuse cirrus emission in the Milky Way, and we include a component of cold grains in thermal equilibrium with adjustable temperature in the range 15-25 K. Our model is both simple and versatile enough that it can be used to derive statistical constraints on the star formation histories and dust contents of large samples of galaxies using a wide range of ultraviolet, optical and infrared observations. We illustrate this by deriving median likelihood estimates of the star formation rates, stellar masses, effective dust optical depths, dust masses and relative strengths of different dust components of 66 well-studied nearby star-forming galaxies from the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxy Survey (SINGS). We explore how the constraints derived in this way depend on the available spectral information. From our analysis of the SINGS sample, we conclude that the mid- and far-infrared colours of galaxies correlate strongly with the specific star formation rate, as well as with other galaxy-wide quantities connected to this parameter, such as the ratio of infrared luminosity between stellar birth clouds and the ambient ISM, the contributions by PAHs and grains in thermal equilibrium to the total infrared emission, and the ratio of dust mass to stellar mass. Our model can be straightforwardly applied to interpret ultraviolet, optical and infrared spectral energy distributions from any galaxy sample.},

For z\textasciitilde 2 galaxies with moderate luminosities (L8{$\mu$}m{$<$}1011 Lsolar), we find that the SFR can be estimated consistently from the multiwavelength data based on local luminosity correlations. However, 20\%-30\% of massive galaxies, and nearly all those with L8{$\mu$}m{$>$}1011 Lsolar, show a mid-IR excess that is likely due to the presence of obscured active nuclei, as shown in a companion paper. There is a tight and roughly linear correlation between stellar mass and SFR for 24 {$\mu$}m-detected galaxies. For a given mass, the SFR at z=2 was larger by a factor of \textasciitilde 4 and \textasciitilde 30 relative to that in star-forming galaxies at z=1 and 0, respectively. Typical ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) at z=2 are relatively ``transparent'' to ultraviolet light, and their activity is long lived ({$>\sptilde$}400 Myr), unlike that in local ULIRGs and high-redshift submillimeter-selected galaxies. ULIRGs are the common mode of star formation in massive galaxies at z=2, and the high duty cycle suggests that major mergers are not the dominant trigger for this activity. Current galaxy formation models underpredict the normalization of the mass-SFR correlation by about a factor of 4 and the space density of ULIRGs by an order of magnitude but give better agreement for z{$>$}1.4 quiescent galaxies.},

  abstract = {We examine the growth and evolution of quenched galaxies in the Mufasa cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that include an evolving halo mass-based quenching prescription, with galaxy colours computed accounting for line-of-sight extinction to individual star particles. Mufasa reproduces the observed present-day red sequence quite well, including its slope, amplitude, and scatter. In Mufasa, the red sequence slope is driven entirely by the steep stellar mass-stellar metallicity relation, which independently agrees with observations. High-mass star-forming galaxies blend smoothly onto the red sequence, indicating the lack of a well-defined green valley at M*{$>$}10\^10.5 Mo. The most massive galaxies quench the earliest and then grow very little in mass via dry merging; they attain their high masses at earlier epochs when cold inflows more effectively penetrate hot halos. To higher redshifts, the red sequence becomes increasingly contaminated with massive dusty star-forming galaxies; UVJ selection subtly but effectively separates these populations. We then examine the evolution of the mass functions of central and satellite galaxies split into passive and star-forming via UVJ. Massive quenched systems show good agreement with observations out to z\textasciitilde 2, despite not including a rapid early quenching mode associated with mergers. However, low-mass quenched galaxies are far too numerous at z{$<$}1 in Mufasa, indicating that Mufasa strongly over-quenches satellites. A challenge for hydrodynamic simulations is to devise a quenching model that produces enough early massive quenched galaxies and keeps them quenched to z=0, while not being so strong as to over-quench satellites; Mufasa only succeeds at the former.},

  abstract = {DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument) is a Stage IV ground-based dark energy experiment that will study baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and the growth of structure through redshift-space distortions with a wide-area galaxy and quasar redshift survey. To trace the underlying dark matter distribution, spectroscopic targets will be selected in four classes from imaging data. We will measure luminous red galaxies up to \$z=1.0\$. To probe the Universe out to even higher redshift, DESI will target bright [O II] emission line galaxies up to \$z=1.7\$. Quasars will be targeted both as direct tracers of the underlying dark matter distribution and, at higher redshifts (\$ 2.1 {$<$} z {$<$} 3.5\$), for the Ly-\$\textbackslash alpha\$ forest absorption features in their spectra, which will be used to trace the distribution of neutral hydrogen. When moonlight prevents efficient observations of the faint targets of the baseline survey, DESI will conduct a magnitude-limited Bright Galaxy Survey comprising approximately 10 million galaxies with a median \$z\textbackslash approx 0.2\$. In total, more than 30 million galaxy and quasar redshifts will be obtained to measure the BAO feature and determine the matter power spectrum, including redshift space distortions.},

The DESI instrument is a robotically-actuated, fiber-fed spectrograph capable of taking up to 5,000 simultaneous spectra over a wavelength range from 360 nm to 980 nm. The fibers feed ten three-arm spectrographs with resolution \$R= \textbackslash lambda/\textbackslash Delta\textbackslash lambda\$ between 2000 and 5500, depending on wavelength. The DESI instrument will be used to conduct a five-year survey designed to cover 14,000 deg\$\^2\$. This powerful instrument will be installed at prime focus on the 4-m Mayall telescope in Kitt Peak, Arizona, along with a new optical corrector, which will provide a three-degree diameter field of view. The DESI collaboration will also deliver a spectroscopic pipeline and data management system to reduce and archive all data for eventual public use.},

  abstract = {The DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys ({$<$}A href="http://legacysurvey.org/"{$>$}http://legacysurvey.org/{$<$}/A{$>$}) are a combination of three public projects (the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey, the Beijing-Arizona Sky Survey, and the Mayall z-band Legacy Survey) that will jointly image {$\approx$}14,000 deg\textsuperscript{2} of the extragalactic sky visible from the northern hemisphere in three optical bands (g, r, and z) using telescopes at the Kitt Peak National Observatory and the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory. The combined survey footprint is split into two contiguous areas by the Galactic plane. The optical imaging is conducted using a unique strategy of dynamically adjusting the exposure times and pointing selection during observing that results in a survey of nearly uniform depth. In addition to calibrated images, the project is delivering a catalog, constructed by using a probabilistic inference-based approach to estimate source shapes and brightnesses. The catalog includes photometry from the grz optical bands and from four mid-infrared bands (at 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 {$\mu$}m) observed by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer satellite during its full operational lifetime. The project plans two public data releases each year. All the software used to generate the catalogs is also released with the data. This paper provides an overview of the Legacy Surveys project.},

We quantify the systematic uncertainties related to different criteria to classify star-forming vs. quiescent galaxies, different SFR estimates, and by accounting for the star formation measured within different physical apertures. The TNG model returns the observed features of the UVJ diagram at \$z\textbackslash leq2\$, with a clear separation between two classes of galaxies. It also returns a tight star-forming main sequence (MS) for \$M\_*{$<$}10\^\{10.5\}\textbackslash,\textbackslash rm M\_\textbackslash odot\$ with a \$\textbackslash sim0.3\$ dex scatter at \$z\textbackslash sim0\$ in our fiducial choices. If a UVJ-based cut is adopted, the TNG MS exhibits a downwardly bending at stellar masses of about \$10\^\{10.5-10.7\}\textasciitilde\textbackslash rm M\_\textbackslash odot\$. Moreover, the model predicts that \$\textbackslash sim80\textbackslash,(50)\$ per cent of \$10\^\{10.5-11\}\textasciitilde\textbackslash rm M\_\textbackslash odot\$ galaxies at \$z=0\textasciitilde (z=2)\$ are quiescent and the numbers of quenched galaxies at intermediate redshifts and high masses are in better agreement with observational estimates than previous models. However, shorter SFR-averaging timescales imply higher normalizations and scatter of the MS, while smaller apertures lead to underestimating the galaxy SFRs: overall we estimate the inspected systematic uncertainties to sum up to about \$0.2-0.3\$ dex in the locus of the MS and to about 15 percentage points in the quenched fractions. While TNG color distributions are clearly bimodal, this is not the case for the SFR logarithmic distributions in bins of stellar mass (SFR\$\textbackslash geq 10\^\{-3\}\textasciitilde\textbackslash rm M\_\textbackslash odot\$yr\$\^\{-1\}\$). Finally, the slope and \$z=0\$ normalization of the TNG MS are consistent with observational findings; however, the locus of the TNG MS remains lower by about \$0.2-0.5\$ dex at \$0.75\textbackslash le z{$<$}2\$ than the available observational estimates taken at face value.},

We show how measurement choices [aperture, quenched definition, and star formation rate (SFR) indicator time-scale], as well as sample selection issues (projection effects, satellite/central misclassification, and host mass distribution sampling), impact this comparison. The quenched definition produces differences of up to 70 (30) percentage points for centrals (satellites) above \textasciitilde 1010.5 M{$\odot$}. At z {$\greaterequivlnt$} 2, a larger aperture within which SFR is measured suppresses the quenched fractions by up to \textasciitilde 50 percentage points. Proper consideration of the stellar and host mass distributions is crucial: Naive comparisons to volume-limited samples from simulations lead to misinterpretation of the quenched fractions as a function of redshift by up to 20 percentage points. Including observational uncertainties to theoretical values of Mstars and SFR changes the quenched fraction values and their trend and/or slope with mass. Taking projected rather than three-dimensional distances for satellites decreases the quenched fractions by up to 10 per cent. TNG produces quenched fractions for both centrals and satellites broadly consistent with observations and predicts up to \textasciitilde 80 (90) per cent of quenched centrals at z = 0 (z = 2), in line with recent observations, and higher than other theoretical models. The quantitative agreement of TNG and Sloan Digital Sky Survey for satellite quenched fractions in groups and clusters depends strongly on the galaxy and host mass range. Our mock comparison highlights the importance of properly accounting for observational effects and biases.},

This method accommodates a broad range of stellar types, from substellar objects to high-mass stars, and phases of evolution, from the pre-main sequence to the white dwarf cooling sequence. I discuss situations in which stellar physics leads to departures from the otherwise monotonic relation between initial stellar mass and lifetime, and how these may be dealt with in isochrone construction. I close with convergence tests and recommendations for the number of points in the uniform basis and the mass between tracks in the original grid required to achieve a certain level accuracy in the resulting isochrones. The programs that implement these methods are free and open-source; they may be obtained from the project webpage.1},

The target catalogue constitutes three contiguous equatorial regions centred at 9h (G09), 12h (G12) and 14.5h (G15) each of 12 \texttimes{} 4 deg2 to limiting fluxes of rpet {$<$} 19.4, rpet {$<$} 19.8 and rpet {$<$} 19.4 mag, respectively (and additional limits at other wavelengths). Spectra and reliable redshifts have been acquired for over 98 per cent of the galaxies within these limits. Here we present the survey footprint, progression, data reduction, redshifting, re-redshifting, an assessment of data quality after 3 yr, additional image analysis products (including ugrizYJHK photometry, S\'ersic profiles and photometric redshifts), observing mask and construction of our core survey catalogue (GamaCore). From this we create three science-ready catalogues: GamaCoreDR1 for public release, which includes data acquired during year 1 of operations within specified magnitude limits (2008 February to April); GamaCoreMainSurvey containing all data above our survey limits for use by the GAMA Team and collaborators; and GamaCoreAtlasSV containing year 1, 2 and 3 data matched to Herschel-ATLAS science demonstration data.

  abstract = {This paper describes algorithms for nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) with the beta-divergence (beta-NMF). The beta-divergence is a family of cost functions parametrized by a single shape parameter beta that takes the Euclidean distance, the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the Itakura-Saito divergence as special cases (beta = 2,1,0, respectively). The proposed algorithms are based on a surrogate auxiliary function (a local majorization of the criterion function). We first describe a majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm that leads to multiplicative updates, which differ from standard heuristic multiplicative updates by a beta-dependent power exponent. The monotonicity of the heuristic algorithm can however be proven for beta in (0,1) using the proposed auxiliary function. Then we introduce the concept of majorization-equalization (ME) algorithm which produces updates that move along constant level sets of the auxiliary function and lead to larger steps than MM. Simulations on synthetic and real data illustrate the faster convergence of the ME approach. The paper also describes how the proposed algorithms can be adapted to two common variants of NMF : penalized NMF (i.e., when a penalty function of the factors is added to the criterion function) and convex-NMF (when the dictionary is assumed to belong to a known subspace).},

One major advantage of the algorithm is that it requires hand-tuning of only 1 or 2 parameters compared to \texttildelow N2 for a traditional algorithm in an N-dimensional parameter space.

Hundreds of planets have been found around Sun-like stars that are either Earth-sized but on shorter periods, or else on year-long orbits but somewhat larger. Under strong assumptions, exoplanet catalogs have been used to make an extrapolated estimate of the rate at which Sun-like stars host Earth analogs. These studies are complicated by the fact that every catalog is censored by non-trivial selection effects and detection efficiencies, and every property (period, radius, etc.) is measured noisily. Here we present a general hierarchical probabilistic framework for making justified inferences about the population of exoplanets, taking into account survey completeness and, for the first time, observational uncertainties. We are able to make fewer assumptions about the distribution than previous studies; we only require that the occurrence rate density be a smooth function of period and radius (employing a Gaussian process). By applying our method to synthetic catalogs, we demonstrate that it produces more accurate estimates of the whole population than standard procedures based on weighting by inverse detection efficiency. We apply the method to an existing catalog of small planet candidates around G dwarf stars. We confirm a previous result that the radius distribution changes slope near Earth's radius. We find that the rate density of Earth analogs is about 0.02 (per star per natural logarithmic bin in period and radius) with large uncertainty. This number is much smaller than previous estimates made with the same data but stronger assumptions.},

We consider two full-spectrum fitting codes: PPXF and STARLIGHT, in fitting for stellar population age, metallicity, mass-to-light ratio, and dust extinction. With PPXF, we find that both the bias {$\mu$} in the population parameters and the scatter {$\sigma$} in the recovered logarithmic values follows the expected trend {$\mu$} {$\propto$} {$\sigma$} {$\propto$} 1/(S/N). The bias increases for younger ages and systematically makes recovered ages older, M*/Lr larger and metallicities lower than the true values. For reference, at S/N = 30, and for the worst case (t = 108 yr), the bias is 0.06 dex in M*/Lr, 0.03 dex in both age and [M/H]. There is no significant dependence on either E(B - V) or the shape of the error spectrum. Moreover, the results are consistent for both our 1-SSP (simple stellar population) and 2-SSP tests. With the STARLIGHT algorithm, we find trends similar to PPXF, when the input E(B - V) {$<$} 0.2 mag. However, with larger input E(B - V), the biases of the output parameter do not converge to zero even at the highest S/N and are strongly affected by the shape of the error spectra. This effect is particularly dramatic for youngest age (t = 108 yr), for which all population parameters can be strongly different from the input values, with significantly underestimated dust extinction and [M/H], and larger ages and M*/Lr. Results degrade when moving from our 1-SSP to the 2-SSP tests. The STARLIGHT convergence to the true values can be improved by increasing Markov Chains and annealing loops to the `slow mode'. For the same input spectrum, PPXF is about two order of magnitudes faster than STARLIGHT's `default mode' and about three order of magnitude faster than STARLIGHT's `slow mode'.},

  abstract = {Three basic ingredients are required to generate a simple stellar population (SSP) library, i.e. an initial mass function (IMF), a stellar evolution model/isochrones, and an empirical/theoretical stellar spectral library. However, there are still some uncertainties to the determination and understanding of these ingredients. We perform the spectral fitting to test the relative parameter offsets between these uncertainties using two different stellar population models, two different empirical stellar libraries, two different isochrones, and the Salpeter and Chabrier IMFs. Based on these setups, we select five SSP libraries generated with the Galaxev/STELIB and Vazdekis/MILES models, and apply them to the pPXF full-spectrum fitting of both MaNGA and mock spectra. We find that: (1) Compared to the Galaxev/STELIB model, spectral fitting qualities with the Vazdekis/MILES model have significant improvements for those metal-rich (especially oversolar) spectra, which cause better reduced {$\chi$}2 distributions and more precisely fitted absorption lines. This might due to the lack of metal-rich stars in the empirical STELIB library, or code improvement of the Vazdekis model. (2) When applying the Vazdekis/MILES model for spectral fitting, the IMF variation will lead to not only a systematic offset in M*/Lr, but also offsets in age and metallicity, and these offsets increase with increasing stellar population ages. However, the IMF variation caused metallicity offsets disappear in the case of Galaxev/STELIB based libraries. (3) The Padova2000 model provides a better match to the MaNGA galaxy spectra at [M/H]L {$<$} -1.0, while the BaSTI model match the local galaxy spectra better at [M/H]L {$>$} -1.0. Current tests suggest that spectral fitting with the Vazdekis/MILES + BaSTI combination would be a better choice for local galaxies.},

We examine the relative number of quenched versus star-forming dwarf galaxies, defining quenched galaxies as having no H{$\alpha$} emission (EWH{$\alpha$} {$<$} 2 \AA ) and a strong 4000 \AA{} break. The fraction of quenched dwarf galaxies decreases rapidly with increasing distance from a massive host, leveling off for distances beyond 1.5 Mpc. We define galaxies beyond 1.5 Mpc of a massive host galaxy to be in the field. We demonstrate that there is a stellar mass threshold of M stellar {$<$} 1.0 \texttimes{} 109 M {$\odot$} below which quenched galaxies do not exist in the field. Below this threshold, we find that none of the 2951 field dwarf galaxies are quenched; all field dwarf galaxies show evidence for recent star formation. Correcting for volume effects, this corresponds to a 1{$\sigma$} upper limit on the quenched fraction of 0.06\%. In more dense environments, quenched galaxies account for 23\% of the dwarf population over the same stellar mass range. The majority of quenched dwarf galaxies (often classified as dwarf elliptical galaxies) are within 2 virial radii of a massive galaxy, and only a few percent of quenched dwarf galaxies exist beyond 4 virial radii. Thus, for galaxies with stellar mass less than 1.0 \texttimes{} 109 M {$\odot$}, ending star formation requires the presence of a more massive neighbor, providing a stringent constraint on models of star formation feedback.},

Illustris is an N-body/hydrodynamical simulation that evolves 2 \texttimes{} 18203 resolution elements in a (106.5 Mpc)3 box from cosmological initial conditions down to z = 0 using the AREPO moving-mesh code. The simulation uses a state-of-the-art set of physical models for galaxy formation that was tuned to reproduce the z = 0 stellar mass function and the history of the cosmic star formation rate density. We find that Illustris successfully reproduces a plethora of observations of galaxy populations at various redshifts, for which no tuning was performed, and provide predictions for future observations. In particular, we discuss (a) the buildup of galactic mass, showing stellar mass functions and the relations between stellar mass and halo mass from z = 7 to 0, (b) galaxy number density profiles around massive central galaxies out to z = 4, (c) the gas and total baryon content of both galaxies and their haloes for different redshifts, and as a function of mass and radius, and (d) the evolution of galaxy specific star formation rates up to z = 8. In addition, we (i) present a qualitative analysis of galaxy morphologies from z = 5 to 0, for the stellar as well as the gaseous components, and their appearance in Hubble Space Telescope mock observations, (ii) follow galaxies selected at z = 2 to their z = 0 descendants, and quantify their growth and merger histories, and (iii) track massive z = 0 galaxies to high redshift and study their joint evolution in star formation activity and compactness. We conclude with a discussion of several disagreements with observations, and lay out possible directions for future research.},

In this paper we present and describe the sample, and explore some basic properties of SDSS galaxies with resolved emission-line fields. We fit the H{$\alpha$}+[N II] emission lines in each spectrum to derive maps of continuum, H{$\alpha$} flux, velocity and velocity dispersion. The H{$\alpha$}, H{$\beta$}, [N II] and [O III] emission lines are also fit in summed spectra for circular annuli of increasing radius. A simple mass model is used to estimate dynamical mass within 10 kpc, which compared to estimates of stellar mass shows that between 10 and 100 per cent of total mass is in stars. We present plots showing the radial behaviour of equivalent width (EW)[H{$\alpha$}], u-i colour and emission-line ratios. Although EW[H{$\alpha$}] and u-i colour trace current or recent star formation, the radial profiles are often quite different. Whilst line ratios do vary with annular radius, radial gradients in galaxies with central line ratios typical of active galactic nucleus (AGN) or low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions are mild, with a hard component of ionization required out to large radii. We use our VIMOS maps to quantify the fraction of H{$\alpha$} emission contained within the SDSS fibre, taking the ratio of total H{$\alpha$} flux to that of a simulated SDSS fibre. A comparison of the flux ratios to colour-based SDSS extrapolations shows a 175 per cent dispersion in the ratio of estimated to actual corrections in normal star-forming galaxies, with larger errors in galaxies containing AGN. We find a strong correlation between indicators of nuclear activity: galaxies with AGN-like line ratios and/or radio emission frequently show enhanced dispersion peaks in their cores, requiring non-thermal sources of heating. Altogether, about half of the galaxies in our sample show no evidence for nuclear activity or non-thermal heating.

We combine a high resolution cosmological \$N\$-body simulation with observed evolutionary trends of the "star formation main sequence," quiescent fraction, and stellar mass function at \$z {$<$} 1\$ to construct a model that statistically tracks the star formation histories and quenching of central galaxies. Comparing this model to the distribution of central galaxy star formation rates in a group catalog of the SDSS Data Release 7, we constrain the timescales over which physical processes cease star formation in central galaxies. Over the stellar mass range \$10\^\{9.5\}\$ to \$10\^\{11\} \textbackslash mathrm\{M\}\_\textbackslash odot\$ we infer quenching e-folding times that span \$1.5\$ to \$0.5\textbackslash; \textbackslash mathrm\{Gyr\}\$ with more massive central galaxies quenching faster. For \$\textbackslash mathcal\{M\}\_* = 10\^\{10.5\}\textbackslash mathrm\{M\}\_\textbackslash odot\$, this implies a total migration time of \$\textbackslash sim 4\textasciitilde\textbackslash mathrm\{Gyrs\}\$ from the star formation main sequence to quiescence. Compared to satellites, central galaxies take \$\textbackslash sim 2\textasciitilde\textbackslash mathrm\{Gyrs\}\$ longer to quench their star formation, suggesting that different mechanisms are responsible for quenching centrals versus satellites. Finally, the central galaxy quenching timescale we infer provides key constraints for proposed star formation quenching mechanisms. Our timescale is generally consistent with gas depletion timescales predicted by quenching through strangulation. However, the exact physical mechanism(s) responsible for this still remain unclear.},

We present a flexible data-driven approach for identifying this SFS over a wide range of SFRs and stellar masses using Gaussian mixture modeling (GMM). Using this method, we present a consistent comparison of the z = 0 SFSs of central galaxies in the Illustris, Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environment, and MUFASA hydrodynamic simulations and the Santa Cruz semianalytic model (SC-SAM), alongside data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find, surprisingly, that the amplitude of the SFS varies by up to{\~ }0.7 dex (factor of{\~ }5) among the simulations with power-law slopes ranging from 0.7 to 1.2. In addition to the SFS, our GMM method also identifies subcomponents in the SFR-stellar mass plane corresponding to starburst, transitioning, and quiescent subpopulations. The hydrodynamic simulations are similarly dominated by SFS and quiescent subpopulations unlike the SC-SAM, which predicts substantial fractions of transitioning and starburst galaxies at stellar masses above and below \{10\}\textsuperscript{10} \{M\}\textsubscript{{$\Sun$} }, respectively. All of the simulations also produce an abundance of low mass quiescent central galaxies in apparent tension with observations. These results illustrate that, even among models that well reproduce many observables of the galaxy population, the z = 0 SFS and other subpopulations still show marked differences that can provide strong constraints on galaxy formation models.},

SF galaxies are found to have a tight relationship between their star formation rates and stellar masses on the so-called "star-forming sequence" (SFS), which characterizes their SF histories and \$M\_*\$ growths. Meanwhile, observed SHMR constraints connect \$M\_*\$ growth to halo accretion history.

We find that the scatter in SHMR at \$M\_h=10\^\{12\}M\_\textbackslash odot\$, \$\textbackslash sigma\_\{M\_*|M\_h=10\^\{12\}M\_\textbackslash odot\}\$, is sensitive to the timescale of star formation variability, \$t\_\{\textbackslash rm duty\}\$, and the correlation coefficient, \$r\$, between SF and halo accretion histories: shorter \$t\_\{\textbackslash rm duty\}\$ and higher \$r\$ both result in tighter \$\textbackslash sigma\_\{M\_*|M\_h=10\^\{12\}M\_\textbackslash odot\}\$.

For \$r\textbackslash sim0.6\$, as found in the literature, \$t\_\{\textbackslash rm duty\}{$<$}0.2\$ Gyr is necessary.

  abstract = {We present the Empirical Dust Attenuation (EDA) framework -- a flexible prescription for assigning realistic dust attenuation to simulated galaxies based on their physical properties. We use the EDA to forward model synthetic observations for three state-of-the-art large-scale cosmological hydrodynamical simulations: SIMBA, IllustrisTNG, and EAGLE. We then compare the optical and UV color-magnitude relations, \$(g-r) - M\_r\$ and \$(FUV-NUV)-M\_r\$, of the simulations to a \$M\_r {$<$} -20\$ and UV complete SDSS galaxy sample using likelihood-free inference. Without dust, none of the simulations match observations, as expected. With the EDA, however, we can reproduce the observed color-magnitude with all three simulations. Furthermore, the attenuation curves predicted by our dust prescription are in good agreement with the observed attenuation-slope relations and attenuation curves of star-forming galaxies. However, the EDA does not predict star-forming galaxies with low \$A\_V\$ since simulated star-forming galaxies are intrinsically much brighter than observations. Additionally, the EDA provides, for the first time, predictions on the attenuation curves of quiescent galaxies, which are challenging to measure observationally. Simulated quiescent galaxies require shallower attenuation curves with lower amplitude than star-forming galaxies. The EDA, combined with forward modeling, provides an effective approach for shedding light on dust in galaxies and probing hydrodynamical simulations. This work also illustrates a major limitation in comparing galaxy formation models: by adjusting dust attenuation, simulations that predict significantly different galaxy populations can reproduce the same UV and optical observations.},

The method is a simple implementation of a hierarchical Bayesian model; it can also be seen as a kind of heteroscedastic deconvolution. It can be applied to any quantity measured with finite precision\textemdash other orbital parameters, or indeed any astronomical measurements of any kind, including magnitudes, distances, or photometric redshifts\textemdash so long as the measurements have been communicated as a likelihood function or a posterior sampling.},

We compile the SFHs of galaxies at z = 0 from an extensive set of models, ranging from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations (Illustris, IllustrisTNG, Mufasa, Simba, EAGLE), zoom simulations (FIRE-2, g14, and Marvel/Justice League), semi-analytic models (Santa Cruz SAM) and empirical models (UniverseMachine), and quantify the variability of these SFHs on different time-scales using the power spectral density (PSD) formalism. We find that the PSDs are well described by broken power laws, and variability on long time-scales ({$\greaterequivlnt$}1 Gyr) accounts for most of the power in galaxy SFHs. Most hydrodynamical models show increased variability on shorter time-scales ({$\lessequivlnt$}300 Myr) with decreasing stellar mass. Quenching can induce \texttildelow 0.4-1 dex of additional power on time-scales {$>$}1 Gyr. The dark matter accretion histories of galaxies have remarkably self-similar PSDs and are coherent with the in situ star formation on time-scales {$>$}3 Gyr. There is considerable diversity among the different models in their (i) power due to star formation rate variability at a given time-scale, (ii) amount of correlation with adjacent time-scales (PSD slope), (iii) evolution of median PSDs with stellar mass, and (iv) presence and locations of breaks in the PSDs. The PSD framework is a useful space to study the SFHs of galaxies since model predictions vary widely. Observational constraints in this space will help constrain the relative strengths of the physical processes responsible for this variability.},

However, Slice Sampling's performance is highly sensitive to the user-specified initial length scale hyperparameter. Moreover, Slice Sampling generally struggles with poorly scaled or strongly correlated distributions. This paper introduces Ensemble Slice Sampling, a new class of algorithms that bypasses such difficulties by adaptively tuning the length scale. Furthermore, Ensemble Slice Sampling's performance is immune to linear correlations by exploiting an ensemble of parallel walkers. These algorithms are trivial to construct, require no hand-tuning, and can easily be implemented in parallel computing environments. Empirical tests show that Ensemble Slice Sampling can improve efficiency by more than an order of magnitude compared to conventional MCMC methods on highly correlated target distributions such as the Autoregressive Process of Order 1 and the Correlated Funnel distribution.},

It is based on two stellar absorption-line indices, the 4000-\AA{} break strength and the Balmer absorption-line index H{$\delta$}A. Together, these indices allow us to constrain the mean stellar ages of galaxies and the fractional stellar mass formed in bursts over the past few Gyr. A comparison with broad-band photometry then yields estimates of dust attenuation and of stellar mass. We generate a large library of Monte Carlo realizations of different star formation histories, including starbursts of varying strength and a range of metallicities. We use this library to generate median likelihood estimates of burst mass fractions, dust attenuation strengths, stellar masses and stellar mass-to-light ratios for a sample of 122808 galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The typical 95 per cent confidence range in our estimated stellar masses is +/-40 per cent. We study how the stellar mass-to-light ratios of galaxies vary as a function of absolute magnitude, concentration index and photometric passband and how dust attenuation varies as a function of absolute magnitude and 4000-\AA{} break strength. We also calculate how the total stellar mass of the present Universe is distributed over galaxies as a function of their mass, size, concentration, colour, burst mass fraction and surface mass density. We find that most of the stellar mass in the local Universe resides in galaxies that have, to within a factor of approximately 2, stellar masses \textasciitilde 5\texttimes{} 1010Msolar, half-light radii \textasciitilde 3 kpc and half-light surface mass densities \textasciitilde 109 Msolar kpc-2.

Based on similarities between the full SED shapes (0.3-8 {$\mu$}m), we have divided galaxies in 32 different spectral classes and stacked their photometry. As each class contains galaxies over a range in redshift, the resulting rest-frame SEDs are well sampled in wavelength and show various spectral features including H{$\alpha$} and the UV dust bump at 2175 \AA. We fit all composite SEDs with flexible stellar population synthesis models, while exploring attenuation curves with varying slopes and UV bump strengths. The Milky Way and Calzetti law provide poor fits at UV wavelengths for nearly all SEDs. Consistent with previous studies, we find that the best-fit attenuation law varies with spectral type. There is a strong correlation between the best-fit dust slope and UV bump strength, with steeper laws having stronger bumps. Moreover, the attenuation curve correlates with specific star formation rate (SFR), with more active galaxies having shallower dust curves and weaker bumps. There is also a weak correlation with inclination. The observed trends can be explained by differences in the dust-to-star geometry, a varying grain size distribution, or a combination of both. Our results have several implications for galaxy evolution studies. First, the assumption of a universal dust model leads to biases in derived galaxy properties. Second, the presence of a dust bump may result in underestimated values for the UV slope, used to correct SFRs of distant galaxies.},

There is psychological and physiological evidence for parts-based representations in the brain, and certain computational theories of object recognition rely on such representations. But little is known about how brains or computers might learn the parts of objects. Here we demonstrate an algorithm for non-negative matrix factorization that is able to learn parts of faces and semantic features of text. This is in contrast to other methods, such as principal components analysis and vector quantization, that learn holistic, not parts-based, representations. Non-negative matrix factorization is distinguished from the other methods by its use of non-negativity constraints. These constraints lead to a parts-based representation because they allow only additive, not subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix factorization is implemented as a neural network, parts-based representations emerge by virtue of two properties: the firing rates of neurons are never negative and synaptic strengths do not change sign.},

Interpreting these data is a challenge for models: many studies have shown that properties derived from modeling galaxy photometry are uncertain by a factor of two or more, and yet answering key questions in the field now requires higher accuracy than this. Here, we present a new model framework specifically designed for these complexities. Our model, Prospector- {$\alpha$}, includes dust attenuation and re-radiation, a flexible attenuation curve, nebular emission, stellar metallicity, and a six-component nonparametric star formation history. The flexibility and range of the parameter space, coupled with Monte Carlo Markov chain sampling within the Prospector inference framework, is designed to provide unbiased parameters and realistic error bars. We assess the accuracy of the model with aperture-matched optical spectroscopy, which was excluded from the fits. We compare spectral features predicted solely from fits to the broadband photometry to the observed spectral features. Our model predicts H{$\alpha$} luminosities with a scatter of \texttildelow 0.18 dex and an offset of \texttildelow 0.1 dex across a wide range of morphological types and stellar masses. This agreement is remarkable, as the H{$\alpha$} luminosity is dependent on accurate star formation rates, dust attenuation, and stellar metallicities. The model also accurately predicts dust-sensitive Balmer decrements, spectroscopic stellar metallicities, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon mass fractions, and the age- and metallicity-sensitive features Dn4000 and H{$\delta$}. Although the model passes all these tests, we caution that we have not yet assessed its performance at higher redshift or the accuracy of recovered stellar masses.},

  abstract = {Nonparametric star formation histories (SFHs) have long promised to be the ``gold standard'' for galaxy spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling as they are flexible enough to describe the full diversity of SFH shapes, whereas parametric models rule out a significant fraction of these shapes a priori. However, this flexibility is not fully constrained even with high-quality observations, making it critical to choose a well-motivated prior. Here, we use the SED-fitting code Prospector to explore the effect of different nonparametric priors by fitting SFHs to mock UV-IR photometry generated from a diverse set of input SFHs. First, we confirm that nonparametric SFHs recover input SFHs with less bias and return more accurate errors than do parametric SFHs. We further find that, while nonparametric SFHs robustly recover the overall shape of the input SFH, the primary determinant of the size and shape of the posterior star formation rate as a function of time (SFR(t)) is the choice of prior, rather than the photometric noise. As a practical demonstration, we fit the UV-IR photometry of{\~ }6000 galaxies from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly survey and measure scatters between priors to be 0.1 dex in mass, 0.8 dex in SFR\textsubscript{100 Myr}, and 0.2 dex in mass-weighted ages, with the bluest star-forming galaxies showing the most sensitivity. An important distinguishing characteristic for nonparametric models is the characteristic timescale for changes in SFR(t). This difference controls whether galaxies are assembled in bursts or in steady-state star formation, corresponding respectively to (feedback-dominated/accretion-dominated) models of galaxy formation and to (larger/smaller) confidence intervals derived from SED fitting. High-quality spectroscopy has the potential to further distinguish between these proposed models of SFR(t).},

We employ a new methodology to infer the mass function from the observed stellar masses: instead of fitting independent mass functions in a series of fixed redshift intervals, we construct a continuity model that directly fits for the redshift evolution of the mass function. This approach ensures a smooth picture of galaxy assembly and makes use of the full, non-Gaussian uncertainty contours in our stellar mass inferences. The resulting mass function has higher number densities at a fixed stellar mass than almost any other measurement in the literature, largely owing to the older stellar ages inferred by \textbackslash texttt\{Prospector\}.

(1994)]\{ref19\}, and [Bessell et al. (1989, 1991)]\{ref6\}, respectively. The combined library has been intended for multiple-purpose synthetic photometry applications and was constructed according to the precepts adopted by [Buser \&amp; Kurucz (1992)]\{ref14\}: (i) to cover the largest possible ranges in stellar parameters (T\textsubscript{eff}, log g, and [M/H]); (ii) to provide flux spectra with useful resolution on the uniform grid of wavelengths adopted by [Kurucz (1995)]\{ref26\}; and (iii) to provide synthetic broad--band colors which are highly realistic for the largest possible parameter and wavelength ranges. Because the most astrophysically relevant step consists in establishing a realistic library, the corresponding color calibration is described in some detail. Basically, for each value of the effective temperature and for each wavelength, we calculate the correction function that must be applied to a (theoretical) solar-abundance model flux spectrum in order for this to yield synthetic UBVRIJHKL colors matching the (empirical) color-temperature calibrations derived from observations. In this way, the most important systematic differences existing between the original model spectra and the observations can indeed be eliminated. On the other hand, synthetic UBV and Washington ultraviolet excesses delta\_\{(U-B)\} and delta\_\{(C-M)\} and delta\_\{(C-T\vphantom\}\textsubscript{1})\vphantom\{\} obtained from the original giant and dwarf model spectra are in excellent accord with empirical metal-abundance calibrations ([Lejeune \&amp; Buser 1996]\{ref30\}). Therefore, the calibration algorithm is designed in such a way as to preserve the original differential grid properties implied by metallicity and/or luminosity changes in the new library, if the above correction function for a solar-abundance model of a given effective temperature is also applied to models of the same temperature but different chemical compositions [M/H] and/or surface gravities log g. While the new library constitutes a first-order approximation to the program set out above, it will be allowed to develop toward the more ambitious goal of matching the full requirements imposed on a standard library. Major input for refinement and completion is expected from the extensive tests now being made in population and evolutionary synthesis studies of the integrated light of globular clusters ([Lejeune 1997]\{ref29\}) and galaxies ([Bruzual et al. 1997]\{ref10\}).},

The grid includes M dwarf model spectra, hence complementing the first library version established in Paper I (\textbackslash cite[Lejeune et al. 1997]\{leje97\}). It covers wide ranges of fundamental parameters: \{T\_eff\}: 50 000 K \textbackslash sim 2000 K, {$\lessgtr$}:break 5.5 \textbackslash sim -1.02, and \{[M/H]\}: +1.0 \textbackslash sim -5.0. A correction procedure is also applied to the theoretical spectra in order to provide color-calibrated flux distributions over a large domain of effective temperatures. For this purpose, empirical \{T\_eff\}-color calibrations are constructed between 11500 K and 2000 K, and semi-empirical calibrations for non-solar abundances (\{[M/H]\} = -3.5 to +1.0) are established. Model colors and bolometric corrections for both the original and the corrected spectra, synthesized in the (UBV)\_J(RI)\_CJHKLL'M system, are given for the full range of stellar parameters. We find that the corrected spectra provide a more realistic representation of empirical stellar colors, though the method employed is not completely adapted to the lowest temperature models. In particular the original differential colors of the grid implied by metallicity and/or luminosity changes are not preserved below 2500 K. Limitations of the correction method used are also discussed.

  abstract = {We use a complete and uniform sample of almost half a million galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to characterize the distribution of stellar mass in the low-redshift Universe. Galaxy abundances are well determined over almost four orders of magnitude in stellar mass and are reasonably but not perfectly fit by a Schechter function with characteristic stellar mass m* = 6.7 \texttimes{} 1010Msolar and with faint-end slope {$\alpha$} = -1.155. For a standard cosmology and a standard stellar initial mass function, only 3.5 per cent of the baryons in the low-redshift Universe are locked up in stars. The projected autocorrelation function of stellar mass is robustly and precisely determined for rp {$<$} 30h-1Mpc. Over the range 10h-1kpc {$<$} rp {$<$} 10h-1Mpc, it is extremely well represented by a power law. The corresponding three-dimensional autocorrelation function is {$\xi$}*(r) = (r/6.1h-1Mpc)-1.84. Relative to the dark matter, the bias of the stellar mass distribution is approximately constant on large scales, but varies by a factor of 5 for rp {$<$} 1h-1Mpc. This behaviour is approximately but not perfectly reproduced by current models for galaxy formation in the concordance {$\Lambda$}cold dark matter cosmology. Detailed comparison suggests that a fluctuation amplitude {$\sigma$}8 \textasciitilde{} 0.8 is preferred to the somewhat larger value adopted in the Millennium Simulation models with which we compare our data. This comparison also suggests that observations of stellar mass autocorrelations as a function of redshift might provide a powerful test for the nature of Dark Energy.},

  abstract = {A trustworthy estimate of the redshift distribution \$n(z)\$ is crucial for using weak gravitational lensing and large-scale structure of galaxy catalogs to study cosmology. Spectroscopic redshifts for the dim and numerous galaxies of next-generation weak-lensing surveys are expected to be unavailable, making photometric redshift (photo-\$z\$) probability density functions (PDFs) the next-best alternative for comprehensively encapsulating the nontrivial systematics affecting photo-\$z\$ point estimation. The established stacked estimator of \$n(z)\$ avoids reducing photo-\$z\$ PDFs to point estimates but yields a systematically biased estimate of \$n(z)\$ that worsens with decreasing signal-to-noise, the very regime where photo-\$z\$ PDFs are most necessary. We introduce Cosmological Hierarchical Inference with Probabilistic Photometric Redshifts (CHIPPR), a statistically rigorous probabilistic graphical model of redshift-dependent photometry, which correctly propagates the redshift uncertainty information beyond the best-fit estimator of \$n(z)\$ produced by traditional procedures and is provably the only self-consistent way to recover \$n(z)\$ from photo-\$z\$ PDFs. We present the \$\textbackslash texttt\{chippr\}\$ prototype code, noting that the mathematically justifiable approach incurs computational expense. The CHIPPR approach is applicable to any one-point statistic of any random variable, provided the prior probability density used to produce the posteriors is explicitly known; if the prior is implicit, as may be the case for popular photo-\$z\$ techniques, then the resulting posterior PDFs cannot be used for scientific inference. We therefore recommend that the photo-\$z\$ community focus on developing methodologies that enable the recovery of photo-\$z\$ likelihoods with support over all redshifts, either directly or via a known prior probability density.},

Upon completion, the SAGA Survey will spectroscopically identify satellite galaxies brighter than Mr,o = -12.3 around 100 Milky Way (MW) analogs at z {$\sim$} 0.01. In Stage II, we have more than quadrupled the sample size of Stage I, delivering results from 127 satellites around 36 MW analogs with an improved target selection strategy and deep photometric imaging catalogs from the Dark Energy Survey and the Legacy Surveys. We have obtained 25,372 galaxy redshifts, peaking around z = 0.2. These data significantly increase spectroscopic coverage for very low redshift objects in 17 {$<$} ro {$<$} 20.75 around SAGA hosts, creating a unique data set that places the Local Group in a wider context. The number of confirmed satellites per system ranges from zero to nine and correlates with host galaxy and brightest satellite luminosities. We find that the number and luminosities of MW satellites are consistent with being drawn from the same underlying distribution as SAGA systems. The majority of confirmed SAGA satellites are star-forming, and the quenched fraction increases as satellite stellar mass and projected radius from the host galaxy decrease. Overall, the satellite quenched fraction among SAGA systems is lower than that in the Local Group. We compare the luminosity functions and radial distributions of SAGA satellites with theoretical predictions based on cold dark matter simulations and an empirical galaxy-halo connection model and find that the results are broadly in agreement.},

  abstract = {We present the evolution of the stellar mass function (SMF) of galaxies  from z = 4.0 to z = 1.3 measured from a sample constructed from the deep near-infrared Multi-wavelength Survey by Yale-Chile, the Faint Infrared Extragalactic Survey, and the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey-Chandra Deep Field South surveys, all having very high-quality optical to mid-infrared data. This sample, unique in that it combines data from surveys with a large range of depths and areas in a self-consistent way, allowed us to (1) minimize the uncertainty due to cosmic variance and empirically quantify its contribution to the total error budget; (2) simultaneously probe the high-mass end and the low-mass end (down to \textasciitilde 0.05 times the characteristic stellar mass) of the SMF with good statistics; and (3) empirically derive the redshift-dependent completeness limits in stellar mass. We provide, for the first time, a comprehensive analysis of random and systematic uncertainties affecting the derived SMFs, including the effect of metallicity, extinction law, stellar population synthesis model, and initial mass function. We find that the mass density evolves by a factor of \textasciitilde 17+7 -10 since z = 4.0, mostly driven by a change in the normalization {$\Phi$}sstarf. If only random errors are taken into account, we find evidence for mass-dependent evolution, with the low-mass end evolving more rapidly than the high-mass end. However, we show that this result is no longer robust when systematic uncertainties due to the SED-modeling assumptions are taken into account. Another significant uncertainty is the contribution to the overall stellar mass density of galaxies below our mass limit; future studies with WFC3 will provide better constraints on the SMF at masses below 1010 M sun at z{$>$}2. Taking our results at face value, we find that they are in conflict with semianalytic models of galaxy formation. The models predict SMFs that are in general too steep, with too many low-mass galaxies and too few high-mass galaxies. The discrepancy at the high-mass end is susceptible to uncertainties in the models and the data, but the discrepancy at the low-mass end may be more difficult to explain.

The present study has the purpose to discuss the scattering of Balmer lines by both internal dust and in external clouds, taking into account investigations conducted by Mathis (1970, 1972). Numerical treatment of scattering by internal dust is used to show that modest differences in grain albedos have important effects on the emergent fluxes. For most real nebulae, the geometry of the gas and dust is unknown. The effects of dark clouds covering all or some of the nebula is also discussed. The obtained results are applied to real nebulae. Some comments are provided regarding the constraints which the results place on dust in general, both in and outside of H II regions.},

In combination with the power spectrum of the tracers this would allow a more precise measurement of the bias-free velocity divergence power spectrum, f2Pm, with the ultimate, zero noise limit, being that f2Pm can be measured as well as would be possible if velocity divergence was observed directly, with maximum rms improvement factor \textasciitilde{} [5.2({$\beta$}2+2{$\beta$}+2)/{$\beta$}2]1/2 (e.g., simeq 10 times better than a single tracer with {$\beta$} = 0.4). This would allow a determination of fD as a function of redshift with an error as low as \textasciitilde{} 0.1\% (again, in the idealized case of the zero noise limit). The ratio b2/b1 can be determined with an even greater precision than {$\beta$}, potentially producing, when measured as a function of scale, an exquisitely sensitive probe of the onset of non-linear bias. We also extend in more detail previous work on the use of the same technique to measure non-Gaussianity. Currently planned redshift surveys are typically designed with S/N \textasciitilde{} 1 on scales of interest, which severely limits the usefulness of our method. Our results suggest that there are potentially large gains to be achieved from technological or theoretical developments that allow higher S/N, or, in the long term, surveys that simply observe a higher number density of galaxies.},

We have created the first ever full-sky set of coadds combining all publicly available W1 and W2 exposures from both the AllWISE and NEOWISE-Reactivation (NEOWISER) mission phases. We employ an adaptation of the unWISE image coaddition framework, which preserves the native WISE angular resolution and is optimized for forced photometry. By incorporating two additional scans of the entire sky, we not only improve the W1/W2 depths, but also largely eliminate time-dependent artifacts such as off-axis scattered moonlight. We anticipate that our new coadds will have a broad range of applications, including target selection for upcoming spectroscopic cosmology surveys, identification of distant/massive galaxy clusters, and discovery of high-redshift quasars. In particular, our full-depth AllWISE+NEOWISER coadds will be an important input for the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument selection of luminous red galaxy and quasar targets. Our full-depth W1/W2 coadds are already in use within the DECam Legacy Survey (DECaLS) and Mayall z-band Legacy Survey (MzLS) reduction pipelines.

These results suggest that the rate at which star-forming galaxies are quenched increases with decreasing stellar mass, but that the bulk of the stellar mass buildup within the quiescent population occurs around \textasciitilde 1010.8 \{M\}\_\{\textbackslash odot \}. In addition, we conclude that mergers do not appear to be a dominant channel for the stellar mass buildup of galaxies at z {$<$} 1, even among massive (gsim 1011 \{M\}\_\{\textbackslash odot \}) quiescent galaxies.},

These components are: dark matter particles, gas cells, passive gas tracers, stars and stellar wind particles, and supermassive black holes. This data release includes the snapshots at all 136 available redshifts, halo and subhalo catalogs at each snapshot, and two distinct merger trees. Six primary realizations of the Illustris volume are released, including the flagship Illustris-1 run. These include three resolution levels with the fiducial ;full; baryonic physics model, and a dark matter only analog for each. In addition, we provide four distinct, high time resolution, smaller volume ;subboxes;. The total data volume is {$\sim$}265 TB, including {$\sim$}800 full volume snapshots and {$\sim$}30,000 subbox snapshots. We describe the released data products as well as tools we have developed for their analysis. All data may be directly downloaded in its native HDF5 format. Additionally, we release a comprehensive, web-based API which allows programmatic access to search and data processing tasks. In both cases we provide example scripts and a getting-started guide in several languages: currently, IDL, Python, and Matlab. This paper addresses scientific issues relevant for the interpretation of the simulations, serves as a pointer to published and on-line documentation of the project, describes planned future additional data releases, and discusses technical aspects of the release.},

We explore TNG100, a rerun of the original Illustris box, and TNG300, which includes 2 \texttimes{} 25003 resolution elements in a volume 20 times larger. Here, we present first results on the galaxy colour bimodality at low redshift. Accounting for the attenuation of stellar light by dust, we compare the simulated (g - r) colours of 109 {$<$} M{$\star$}/M{$\odot$} {$<$} 1012.5 galaxies to the observed distribution from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find a striking improvement with respect to the original Illustris simulation, as well as excellent quantitative agreement with the observations, with a sharp transition in median colour from blue to red at a characteristic M{$\star$} {$\sim$} 1010.5 M{$\odot$}. Investigating the build-up of the colour-mass plane and the formation of the red sequence, we demonstrate that the primary driver of galaxy colour transition is supermassive black hole feedback in its low accretion state. Across the entire population the median colour transition time-scale {$\Delta$}tgreen is {$\sim$}1.6 Gyr, a value which drops for increasingly massive galaxies. We find signatures of the physical process of quenching: at fixed stellar mass, redder galaxies have lower star formation rates, gas fractions, and gas metallicities; their stellar populations are also older and their large-scale interstellar magnetic fields weaker than in bluer galaxies. Finally, we measure the amount of stellar mass growth on the red sequence. Galaxies with M{$\star$} {$>$} 1011 M{$\odot$} which redden at z {$<$} 1 accumulate on average {$\sim$}25 per cent of their final z = 0 mass post-reddening; at the same time, {$\sim$}18 per cent of such massive galaxies acquire half or more of their final stellar mass while on the red sequence.},

  abstract = {We analyze star formation (SF) as a function of stellar mass  (M*) and redshift z in the All-Wavelength Extended Groth Strip International Survey. For 2905 field galaxies, complete to 1010(1010.8) Msolar at z{$<$}0.7(1), with Keck spectroscopic redshifts out to z=1.1, we compile SF rates (SFRs) from emission lines, GALEX, and Spitzer MIPS 24 {$\mu$}m photometry, optical-NIR M* measurements, and HST morphologies. Galaxies with reliable signs of SF form a distinct ``main sequence'' (MS), with a limited range of SFRs at a given M* and z (1 {$\sigma<\sptilde$}+/-0.3 dex), and log(SFR) approximately proportional to logM*. The range of log(SFR) remains constant to z{$>$}1, while the MS as a whole moves to higher SFR as z increases. The range of the SFR along the MS constrains the amplitude of episodic variations of SF and the effect of mergers on the SFR. Typical galaxies spend \textasciitilde 67\%(95\%) of their lifetime since z=1 within a factor of {$<\sptilde$}2(4) of their average SFR at a given M* and z. The dominant mode of the evolution of SF since z\textasciitilde 1 is apparently a gradual decline of the average SFR in most individual galaxies, not a decreasing frequency of starburst episodes, or a decreasing factor by which SFRs are enhanced in starbursts. LIRGs at z\textasciitilde 1 seem to mostly reflect the high SFR typical for massive galaxies at that epoch. The smooth MS may reflect that the same set of few physical processes governs SF prior to additional quenching processes. A gradual process like gas exhaustion may play a dominant role.},

  abstract = {A crucial question in galaxy formation is what role new accretion has in star formation. Theoretical models have predicted a wide range of correlation strengths between halo accretion and galaxy star formation. Previously, we presented a technique to observationally constrain this correlation strength for isolated Milky Way-mass galaxies at \$z\textbackslash sim 0.12\$, based on the correlation between halo accretion and the density profile of neighbouring galaxies. By applying this technique to both observational data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and simulation data from the UniverseMachine, where we can test different correlation strengths, we ruled out positive correlations between dark matter accretion and recent star formation activity. In this work, we expand our analysis by (1) applying our technique separately to red and blue neighbouring galaxies, which trace different infall populations, (2) correlating dark matter accretion rates with \$D\_\{n\}4000\$ measurements as a longer-term quiescence indicator than instantaneous star-formation rates, and (3) analyzing higher-mass isolated central galaxies with \$10\^\{11.0\} {$<$} M\_*/M\_\textbackslash odot {$<$} 10\^\{11.5\}\$ out to \$z\textbackslash sim 0.18\$. In all cases, our results are consistent with non-positive correlation strengths with \$rsim 85\$ per cent confidence, suggesting that processes such as gas recycling dominate star formation in massive \$z=0\$ galaxies.},

  abstract = {Interpreting observations of distant galaxies in terms of constraints on physical parameters - such as stellar mass (M\ding{72}), star formation rate (SFR) and dust optical depth (\{hat\{{$\tau\rbrace$}V\}) - requires spectral synthesis modelling. We analyse the reliability of these physical parameters as determined under commonly adopted `classical' assumptions: star formation histories assumed to be exponentially declining functions of time, a simple dust law and no emission-line contribution. Improved modelling techniques and data quality now allow us to use a more sophisticated approach, including realistic star formation histories, combined with modern prescriptions for dust attenuation and nebular emission. We present a Bayesian analysis of the spectra and multiwavelength photometry of 1048 galaxies from the 3D-HST survey in the redshift range 0.7 {$<$} z {$<$} 2.8 and in the stellar mass range 9 {$\lessequivlnt$} log (M\ding{72}/M{$\odot$}) {$\lessequivlnt$} 12. We find that, using the classical spectral library, stellar masses are systematically overestimated (\texttildelow 0.1 dex) and SFRs are systematically underestimated (\texttildelow 0.6 dex) relative to our more sophisticated approach. We also find that the simultaneous fit of photometric fluxes and emission-line equivalent widths helps break a degeneracy between SFR and \{hat\{{$\tau\rbrace$}V\}, reducing the uncertainties on these parameters. Finally, we show how the biases of classical approaches can affect the correlation between M\ding{72} and SFR for star-forming galaxies (the `star-formation main sequence'). We conclude that the normalization, slope and scatter of this relation strongly depend on the adopted approach and demonstrate that the classical, oversimplified approach cannot recover the true distribution of M\ding{72} and SFR.\vphantom{\}\}}},

Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) is a suite of open source, robust, efficient, thread-safe libraries for a wide range of applications in computational stellar astrophysics. A one-dimensional stellar evolution module, MESAstar, combines many of the numerical and physics modules for simulations of a wide range of stellar evolution scenarios ranging from very low mass to massive stars, including advanced evolutionary phases. MESAstar solves the fully coupled structure and composition equations simultaneously. It uses adaptive mesh refinement and sophisticated timestep controls, and supports shared memory parallelism based on OpenMP. State-of-the-art modules provide equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, element diffusion data, and atmosphere boundary conditions. Each module is constructed as a separate Fortran 95 library with its own explicitly defined public interface to facilitate independent development. Several detailed examples indicate the extensive verification and testing that is continuously performed and demonstrate the wide range of capabilities that MESA possesses. These examples include evolutionary tracks of very low mass stars, brown dwarfs, and gas giant planets to very old ages; the complete evolutionary track of a 1 M sun star from the pre-main sequence (PMS) to a cooling white dwarf; the solar sound speed profile; the evolution of intermediate-mass stars through the He-core burning phase and thermal pulses on the He-shell burning asymptotic giant branch phase; the interior structure of slowly pulsating B Stars and Beta Cepheids; the complete evolutionary tracks of massive stars from the PMS to the onset of core collapse; mass transfer from stars undergoing Roche lobe overflow; and the evolution of helium accretion onto a neutron star.

Improvements in MESA star's ability to model the evolution of giant planets now extends its applicability down to masses as low as one-tenth that of Jupiter. The dramatic improvement in asteroseismology enabled by the space-based Kepler and CoRoT missions motivates our full coupling of the ADIPLS adiabatic pulsation code with MESA star. This also motivates a numerical recasting of the Ledoux criterion that is more easily implemented when many nuclei are present at non-negligible abundances. This impacts the way in which MESA star calculates semi-convective and thermohaline mixing. We exhibit the evolution of 3-8 M {$\odot$} stars through the end of core He burning, the onset of He thermal pulses, and arrival on the white dwarf cooling sequence. We implement diffusion of angular momentum and chemical abundances that enable calculations of rotating-star models, which we compare thoroughly with earlier work. We introduce a new treatment of radiation-dominated envelopes that allows the uninterrupted evolution of massive stars to core collapse. This enables the generation of new sets of supernovae, long gamma-ray burst, and pair-instability progenitor models. We substantially modify the way in which MESA star solves the fully coupled stellar structure and composition equations, and we show how this has improved the scaling of MESA's calculational speed on multi-core processors. Updates to the modules for equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, and atmospheric boundary conditions are also provided. We describe the MESA Software Development Kit that packages all the required components needed to form a unified, maintained, and well-validated build environment for MESA. We also highlight a few tools developed by the community for rapid visualization of MESA star results.},

MESA can now simultaneously evolve an interacting pair of differentially rotating stars undergoing transfer and loss of mass and angular momentum, greatly enhancing the prior ability to model binary evolution. New MESA capabilities in fully coupled calculation of nuclear networks with hundreds of isotopes now allow MESA to accurately simulate the advanced burning stages needed to construct supernova progenitor models. Implicit hydrodynamics with shocks can now be treated with MESA, enabling modeling of the entire massive star lifecycle, from pre-main-sequence evolution to the onset of core collapse and nucleosynthesis from the resulting explosion. Coupling of the GYRE non-adiabatic pulsation instrument with MESA allows for new explorations of the instability strips for massive stars while also accelerating the astrophysical use of asteroseismology data. We improve the treatment of mass accretion, giving more accurate and robust near-surface profiles. A new MESA capability to calculate weak reaction rates ``on-the-fly'' from input nuclear data allows better simulation of accretion induced collapse of massive white dwarfs and the fate of some massive stars. We discuss the ongoing challenge of chemical diffusion in the strongly coupled plasma regime, and exhibit improvements in MESA that now allow for the simulation of radiative levitation of heavy elements in hot stars. We close by noting that the MESA software infrastructure provides bit-for-bit consistency for all results across all the supported platforms, a profound enabling capability for accelerating MESA's development.},

The overall framework builds upon the successes of the Illustris galaxy formation model, and includes prescriptions for star formation, stellar evolution, chemical enrichment, primordial and metal-line cooling of the gas, stellar feedback with galactic outflows, and black hole formation, growth and multimode feedback. In this paper, we give a comprehensive description of the physical and numerical advances that form the core of the IllustrisTNG (The Next Generation) framework. We focus on the revised implementation of the galactic winds, of which we modify the directionality, velocity, thermal content and energy scalings, and explore its effects on the galaxy population. As described in earlier works, the model also includes a new black-hole-driven kinetic feedback at low accretion rates, magnetohydrodynamics and improvements to the numerical scheme. Using a suite of (25 Mpc h-1)3 cosmological boxes, we assess the outcome of the new model at our fiducial resolution. The presence of a self-consistently amplified magnetic field is shown to have an important impact on the stellar content of 1012 M{$\odot$} haloes and above. Finally, we demonstrate that the new galactic winds promise to solve key problems identified in Illustris in matching observational constraints and affecting the stellar content and sizes of the low-mass end of the galaxy population.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the first cosmological results based on Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and lensing-potential power spectra. We find that the Planck spectra at high multipoles ({$\mathscr{l}$} {$\greaterequivlnt$} 40) are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flat six-parameter {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology with a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations. Within the context of this cosmology, the Planck data determine the cosmological parameters to high precision: the angular size of the sound horizon at recombination, the physical densities of baryons and cold dark matter, and the scalar spectral index are estimated to be \texttheta\textsubscript{{${_\ast}$}} = (1.04147 {$\pm$} 0.00062) \texttimes{} 10\textsuperscript{-2}, {$\Omega$}\textsubscript{b}h\textsuperscript{2} = 0.02205 {$\pm$} 0.00028, {$\Omega$}\textsubscript{c}h\textsuperscript{2} = 0.1199 {$\pm$} 0.0027, and n\textsubscript{s} = 0.9603 {$\pm$} 0.0073, respectively(note that in this abstract we quote 68\% errors on measured parameters and 95\% upper limits on other parameters). For this cosmology, we find a low value of the Hubble constant, H\textsubscript{0} = (67.3 {$\pm$} 1.2) km s\textsuperscript{-1} Mpc\textsuperscript{-1}, and a high value of the matter density parameter, {$\Omega$}\textsubscript{m} = 0.315 {$\pm$} 0.017. These values are in tension with recent direct measurements of H\textsubscript{0} and the magnitude-redshift relation for Type Ia supernovae, but are in excellent agreement with geometrical constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) surveys. Including curvature, we find that the Universe is consistent with spatial flatness to percent level precision using Planck CMB data alone. We use high-resolution CMB data together with Planck to provide greater control on extragalactic foreground components in an investigation of extensions to the six-parameter {$\Lambda$}CDM model. We present selected results from a large grid of cosmological models, using a range of additional astrophysical data sets in addition to Planck and high-resolution CMB data. None of these models are favoured over the standard six-parameter {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology. The deviation of the scalar spectral index from unity isinsensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changes in the matter content of the Universe. We find an upper limit of r\textsubscript{0.002}\&lt; 0.11 on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. There is no evidence for additional neutrino-like relativistic particles beyond the three families of neutrinos in the standard model. Using BAO and CMB data, we find N\textsubscript{eff} = 3.30 {$\pm$} 0.27 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of 0.23 eV for the sum of neutrino masses. Our results are in excellent agreement with big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of N\textsubscript{eff} = 3.046. We find no evidence for dynamical dark energy; using BAO and CMB data, the dark energy equation of state parameter is constrained to be w = -1.13\textsubscript{-0.10}\textsuperscript{+0.13}. We also use the Planck data to set limits on a possible variation of the fine-structure constant, dark matter annihilation and primordial magnetic fields. Despite the success of the six-parameter {$\Lambda$}CDM model in describing the Planck data at high multipoles, we note that this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the temperature power spectrum at low multipoles. The unusual shape of the spectrum in the multipole range 20 {$\lessequivlnt$} {$\mathscr{l}$} {$\lessequivlnt$} 40 was seen previously in the WMAP data and is a real feature of the primordial CMB anisotropies. The poor fit to the spectrum at low multipoles is not of decisive significance, but is an "anomaly" in an otherwise self-consistent analysis of the Planck temperature data.},

These aperture corrections rely on assumptions about the physical properties of galaxies. The adequacy of these aperture corrections can be tested with integral-field spectroscopic data. We use integral-field spectra drawn from 1212 galaxies observed as part of the SAMI Galaxy Survey to investigate the validity of two aperture correction methods that attempt to estimate a galaxy's total instantaneous star formation rate. We show that biases arise when assuming that instantaneous star formation is traced by broad-band imaging, and when the aperture correction is built only from spectra of the nuclear region of galaxies. These biases may be significant depending on the selection criteria of a survey sample. Understanding the sensitivities of these aperture corrections is essential for correct handling of systematic errors in galaxy evolution studies.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we investigate whether the stellar initial mass function (IMF) of early-type galaxies depends on their host environment. To this purpose, we have selected a sample of early-type galaxies from the SPIDER catalogue, characterized their environment through the group catalogue of Wang et al., and used their optical Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectra to constrain the IMF slope, through the analysis of IMF-sensitive spectral indices. To reach a high enough signal-to-noise ratio, we have stacked spectra in velocity dispersion ({$\sigma$}0) bins, on top of separating the sample by galaxy hierarchy and host halo mass, as proxies for galaxy environment. In order to constrain the IMF, we have compared observed line strengths and predictions of MIUSCAT/EMILES synthetic stellar population models, with varying age, metallicity, and `bimodal' (low-mass tapered) IMF slope ({$\Gamma$} \_b). Consistent with previous studies, we find that {$\Gamma$} \_b increases with {$\sigma$}0, becoming bottom-heavy (i.e. an excess of low-mass stars with respect to the Milky Way like IMF) at high {$\sigma$}0. We find that this result is robust against the set of isochrones used in the stellar population models, as well as the way the effect of elemental abundance ratios is taken into account. We thus conclude that it is possible to use currently state-of-the-art stellar population models and intermediate resolution spectra to consistently probe IMF variations. For the first time, we show that there is no dependence of {$\Gamma$}b on environment or galaxy hierarchy, as measured within the 3 arcsec SDSS fibre, thus leaving the IMF as an intrinsic galaxy property, possibly set already at high redshift.},

We obtain dust-corrected SFRs by fitting the GALEX (UV) and SDSS (optical) photometry to a library of population synthesis models that include dust attenuation. For star-forming galaxies, our UV-based SFRs compare remarkably well with those derived from SDSS H alpha. Deviations from perfect agreement between these two methods are due to differences in the dust attenuation estimates. In contrast to H alpha, UV provides reliable SFRs for galaxies with weak or no H alpha emission, and where H alpha is contaminated with an emission from an AGN. We use full-SED SFRs to calibrate a simple prescription that uses GALEX UV magnitudes to produce good SFRs for normal star-forming galaxies. The specific SFR is considered as a function of stellar mass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no AGN, (2) those hosting an AGN, and for (3) galaxies without H alpha emission. We find that the three have distinct star formation histories, with AGN lying intermediate between the star-forming and the quiescent galaxies. Normal star forming galaxies (without an AGN) lie on a relatively narrow linear sequence. Remarkably, galaxies hosting a strong AGN appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. Weak AGN, while also massive, have lower SFR, sometimes extending to the realm of quiescent galaxies. We propose an evolutionary sequence for massive galaxies that smoothly connects normal star-forming galaxies to quiescent (red sequence) galaxies via strong and weak AGN. We confirm that some galaxies with no H alpha emission show signs of SF in the UV. We derive a UV-based cosmic SFR density at z=0.1 with smaller total error than previous measurements (abridged).},

This method is limited by the cosmic variance, by the finite number of structures on the largest scales, and by the partial degeneracy with other cosmological parameters that can mimic the same effect. We propose an alternative method based on the fact that on large scales, halos are linearly biased, but not stochastic, tracers of dark matter: by correlating a highly biased tracer of large scale structure against an unbiased tracer, one eliminates the cosmic variance error, which can lead to a significant increase in signal to noise. For an ideal survey out to z{$\sim$}2, the error reduction can be as large as a factor of 7, which should guarantee a detection of non-Gaussianity from an all-sky survey of this type.},

The original CIGALE builds a grid of theoretical spectral energy distribution (SED) models and fits to photometric fluxes from ultraviolet to infrared to put constraints on parameters related to both formation and evolution of galaxies. Such a grid-based method can lead to a long and challenging parameter extraction since the computation time increases exponentially with the number of parameters considered and results can be dependent on the density of sampling points, which must be chosen in advance for each parameter. MCMC methods, on the other hand, scale approximately linearly with the number of parameters, allowing a faster and more accurate exploration of the parameter space by using a smaller number of efficiently chosen samples. We test our MCMC version of the code CIGALE (called CIGALEMC) with simulated data. After checking the ability of the code to retrieve the input parameters used to build the mock sample, we fit theoretical SEDs to real data from the well-known and -studied Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxy Survey sample. We discuss constraints on the parameters and show the advantages of our MCMC sampling method in terms of accuracy of the results and optimization of CPU time.},

The commonly used tau-model, with SFR \textasciitilde{} exp(-t/tau), provides a poor match to the SFH of our SPH galaxies, with a mismatch between early and late star formation that leads to systematic errors in predicting colours and stellar mass-to-light ratios. A one-parameter lin-exp model, with SFR \textasciitilde{} t*exp(-t/tau), is much more successful on average, but it fails to match the late-time behavior of the bluest, most actively star-forming galaxies and the passive, "red and dead" galaxies. We introduce a 4-parameter model, which transitions from lin-exp to a linear ramp after a transition time, which describes our simulated galaxies very well. We test the ability of these parametrised models to recover (at z=0, 0.5, and 1) the stellar mass-to-light ratios, specific star formation rates, and stellar population ages from the galaxy colours, computed from the full SPH star formation histories using the FSPS code of Conroy et al. (2009). Fits with tau-models systematically overestimate M/L by \textasciitilde{} 0.2 dex, overestimate population ages by \textasciitilde{} 1-2 Gyr, and underestimate sSFR by \textasciitilde{} 0.05 dex. Fits with lin-exp are less biased on average, but the 4-parameter model yields the best results for the full range of galaxies. Marginalizing over the free parameters of the 4-parameter model leads to slightly larger statistical errors than 1-parameter fits but essentially removes all systematic biases, so this is our recommended procedure for fitting real galaxies.},

The clustering of galaxies in the mock for galaxies in different magnitude and redshift bins is in good agreement with measurements from SDSS and GAMA, and the colour-dependent clustering is in reasonable agreement.

Here we review the current status of models that employ two leading techniques to simulate the physics of galaxy formation: semi-analytic models and numerical hydrodynamic simulations. We focus on a set of observational targets that describe the evolution of the global and structural properties of galaxies from roughly Cosmic High Noon (\$z\textbackslash sim 2-3\$) to the present. Although minor discrepancies remain, overall, models show remarkable convergence between different methods and make predictions that are in qualitative agreement with observations. Modelers seem to have converged on a core set of physical processes that are critical for shaping galaxy properties. This core set includes cosmological accretion, strong stellar-driven winds that are more efficient at low masses, black hole feedback that preferentially suppresses star formation at high masses, and structural and morphological evolution through merging and environmental processes. However, all cosmological models currently adopt phenomenological implementations of many of these core processes, which must be tuned to observations. Many details of how these diverse processes interact within a hierarchical structure formation setting remain poorly understood. Emerging multi-scale simulations are helping to bridge the gap between stellar and cosmological scales, placing models on a firmer, more physically grounded footing. Concurrently, upcoming telescope facilities will provide new challenges and constraints for models, particularly by directly constraining inflows and outflows through observations of gas in and around galaxies.},

We demonstrate that comparisons of the short-time-scale variability in galaxy SFRs with observational data provide an additional useful constraint on the physics of galaxy formation feedback. We apply SFR indicators with different sensitivity time-scales to galaxies from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) simulations. We find that the SFR-M* relation has a significantly greater scatter when the H{$\alpha$}-derived SFR is considered compared with when the far-ultraviolet (FUV)-based SFR is used. This difference is a direct consequence of bursty star formation because the FIRE galaxies exhibit order-of-magnitude SFR variations over time-scales of a few Myr. We show that the difference in the scatter between the simulated H{$\alpha$}- and FUV-derived SFR-M* relations at z = 2 is consistent with observational constraints. We also find that the H{$\alpha$}/FUV ratios predicted by the simulations at z = 0 are similar to those observed for local galaxies except for a population of low-mass (M* {$\lessequivlnt$} 109.5 M{$\odot$}) simulated galaxies with lower H{$\alpha$}/FUV ratios than observed.

In postprocessing, we also follow the formation and evolution of the galaxies and quasars. We show that baryon-induced features in the initial conditions of the Universe are reflected in distorted form in the low-redshift galaxy distribution, an effect that can be used to constrain the nature of dark energy with future generations of observational surveys of galaxies.},

  abstract = {Hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation have now reached sufficient volume to make precision predictions for clustering on cosmologically relevant scales. Here, we use our new IllustrisTNG simulations to study the non-linear correlation functions and power spectra of baryons, dark matter, galaxies, and haloes over an exceptionally large range of scales. We find that baryonic effects increase the clustering of dark matter on small scales and damp the total matter power spectrum on scales up to k {$\sim$} 10 h Mpc-1 by 20 per cent. The non-linear two-point correlation function of the stellar mass is close to a power-law over a wide range of scales and approximately invariant in time from very high redshift to the present. The two-point correlation function of the simulated galaxies agrees well with Sloan Digital Sky Survey at its mean redshift z {$\simeq$} 0.1, both as a function of stellar mass and when split according to galaxy colour, apart from a mild excess in the clustering of red galaxies in the stellar mass range of109-1010 h-2 M{$\odot$}. Given this agreement, the TNG simulations can make valuable theoretical predictions for the clustering bias of different galaxy samples. We find that the clustering length of the galaxy autocorrelation function depends strongly on stellar mass and redshift. Its power-law slope {$\gamma$} is nearly invariant with stellar mass, but declines from {$\gamma$} {$\sim$} 1.8 at redshift z = 0 to {$\gamma$} {$\sim$} 1.6 at redshift z {$\sim$} 1, beyond which the slope steepens again. We detect significant scale dependences in the bias of different observational tracers of large-scale structure, extending well into the range of the baryonic acoustic oscillations and causing nominal (yet fortunately correctable) shifts of the acoustic peaks of around {$\sim$} 5 per cent.},

We show that both spectroscopy and photometry are needed to break the dust-age-metallicity degeneracy. We find a large diversity of star-formation histories: although the most massive (\$M\_\{\textbackslash star\}{$>$}2\textbackslash times10\^\{11\}\textasciitilde M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$) galaxies formed the earliest (formation redshift of \$z\_\{\textbackslash rm f\}\textbackslash approx5-10\$ with a short star-formation timescale of \$\textbackslash tau\_\{\textbackslash rm SF\}\textbackslash lesssim1\textasciitilde\textbackslash mathrm\{Gyr\}\$), lower-mass galaxies have a wide range of formation redshifts, leading to only a weak trend of \$z\_\{\textbackslash rm f\}\$ with \$M\_\{\textbackslash star\}\$. Interestingly, several low-mass galaxies with have formation redshifts of \$z\_\{\textbackslash rm f\}\textbackslash approx5-8\$. Star-forming galaxies evolve about the star-forming main sequence, crossing the ridgeline several times in their past. Quiescent galaxies show a wide range and continuous distribution of quenching timescales (\$\textbackslash tau\_\{\textbackslash rm quench\}\textbackslash approx0-5\textasciitilde\textbackslash mathrm\{Gyr\}\$) with a median of \$\textbackslash langle\textbackslash tau\_\{\textbackslash rm quench\}\textbackslash rangle=1.0\_\{-0.9\}\^\{+0.8\}\textasciitilde\textbackslash mathrm\{Gyr\}\$ and of quenching epochs of \$z\_\{\textbackslash rm quench\}\textbackslash approx0.8-5.0\$ (\$\textbackslash langle z\_\{\textbackslash rm quench\}\textbackslash rangle=1.3\_\{-0.4\}\^\{+0.7\}\$). This large diversity of quenching timescales and epochs points toward a combination of internal and external quenching mechanisms. In our sample, rejuvenation and "late bloomers" are uncommon. In summary, our analysis supports the "grow \& quench" framework and is consistent with a wide and continuously-populated diversity of quenching timescales.},

Our main sample of 7840 galaxies contains 1297 M *{$>$}1011 M sun galaxies in the range 0.2 {$<$} z phot {$<$} 1.8. We show empirically that this catalog is approximately complete for M *{$>$}1011 M sun galaxies for z phot {$<$} 1.8. For this mass-limited sample, we show that the locus of the red sequence color-stellar mass relation evolves as {$\Delta$}(u - r) vprop (-0.44 {$\pm$} 0.02)z phot for z phot {$\lessequivlnt$} 1.2. For z phot {$\greaterequivlnt$} 1.3, however, we are no longer able to reliably distinguish red and blue subpopulations from the observed color distribution; we show that this would require much deeper near-infrared data. At 1.5 {$<$} z phot {$<$} 1.8, the comoving number density of M *{$>$}1011 M sun galaxies is {$\approx$}50\% of the local value, with a red fraction of {$\approx$}33\%. Making a parametric fit to the observed evolution, we find n tot(z) vprop (1 + z phot)-0.52{$\pm$}0.12({$\pm$}0.20). We find stronger evolution in the red fraction: f red(z) vprop (1 + z phot)-1.17{$\pm$}0.18({$\pm$}0.21). Through a series of sensitivity analyses, we show that the most important sources of systematic error are (1) systematic differences in the analysis of the z {$\approx$} 0 and z Gt 0 samples; (2) systematic effects associated with details of the photometric redshift calculation; and (3) uncertainties in the photometric calibration. With this in mind, we show that our results based on photometric redshifts are consistent with a completely independent analysis which does not require redshift information for individual galaxies. Our results suggest that, at most, 1/5 of local red sequence galaxies with M *{$>$}1011 M sun were already in place at z \textasciitilde{} 2.},

DEVILS is a deep spectroscopic redshift survey with very high completeness, covering several premier deep fields including COSMOS (D10). Our stellar mass and SFR estimates are self-consistently derived using the spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling code PROSPECT, using well-motivated parametrizations for dust attenuation, star formation histories, and metallicity evolution. We show how these improvements, and especially our physically motivated assumptions about metallicity evolution, have an appreciable systematic effect on the inferred stellar masses, at the level of \textasciitilde 0.2 dex. To illustrate the scientific value of these data, we map the evolving galaxy stellar mass function (SMF) and the SFR-M{$\star$} relation for 0 {$<$} z {$<$} 4.25. In agreement with past studies, we find that most of the evolution in the SMF is driven by the characteristic density parameter, with little evolution in the characteristic mass and low-mass slopes. Where the SFR-M{$\star$} relation is indistinguishable from a power law at z {$>$} 2.6, we see evidence of a bend in the relation at low redshifts (z {$<$} 0.45). This suggests evolution in both the normalization and shape of the SFR-M{$\star$} relation since cosmic noon. It is significant that we only clearly see this bend when combining our new DEVILS measurements with consistently derived values for lower redshift galaxies from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey: this shows the power of having consistent treatment for galaxies at all redshifts.},

  abstract = {The properties of dark matter halos, including mass growth, correlate with larger scale environment at fixed mass, an effect known as assembly bias. However, whether this environmental dependence manifests itself in galaxy properties remains unclear. We apply a group-finding algorithm to DR7 of the SDSS to estimate the halo mass of each galaxy and to decompose galaxies into those that exist at the centers of distinct halos and those that orbit as satellites within larger halos. Using the 4000-A break as a measure of star formation history, we examine the correlation between the quenched fraction of galaxies, f\_q, and large-scale environment, rho. At all galaxy magnitudes, there is a positive, monotonic relationship between f\_q and rho. We use the group catalog to decompose this correlation into the contribution from central and satellite galaxies as a function of halo mass. Because satellites are more likely to be quenched than central galaxies, the observed f\_q-rho correlation is primarily due to variations of the halo mass function with environment, which causes a larger fraction of satellite galaxies at high rho. For low-mass central galaxies (Mgal {$<\sptilde$} 10\^10.0 Msol/h\^2), there is no correlation between f\_q and rho. These results are inconsistent with the strong assembly bias of dark matter halos seen in this mass regime if recent galaxy growth at all correlates with recent halo growth, as we demonstrate through a high resolution N-body simulation. We also find that the mean stellar age of quenched central galaxies is independent of rho at fixed Mgal, while the formation times of low mass halos vary significantly. We conclude that the processes that halt the star formation of low mass central galaxies are not correlated to the formation histories of their host halos, and old galaxies do not reside preferentially in old halos.

The formation histories, and thus ages, of dark matter haloes correlate with their large-scale density {$\rho$}, an effect known as assembly bias. We test whether this correlation extends to galaxies by measuring the dependence of galaxy stellar age on {$\rho$}. To clarify the comparison between theory and observation, and to remove the strong environmental effects on satellites, we use galaxy group catalogues to identify central galaxies and measure their quenched fraction, fQ, as a function of large-scale environment. Models that match halo age to central galaxy age predict a strong positive correlation between fQ and {$\rho$}. However, we show that the amplitude of this effect depends on the definition of halo age: assembly bias is significantly reduced when removing the effects of splashback haloes - those haloes that are central but have passed through a larger halo or experienced strong tidal encounters. Defining age using halo mass at its peak value rather than current mass removes these effects. In Sloan Digital Sky Survey data, at M* {$\greaterequivlnt$} 1010 M{$\odot$} h-2, there is a \texttildelow 5 per cent increase in fQ from low-to-high densities, which is in agreement with predictions of dark matter haloes using peak halo mass. At lower stellar mass there is little to no correlation of fQ with {$\rho$}. For these galaxies, age matching is inconsistent with the data across the range of halo formation metrics that we tested. This implies that halo formation history has a small but statistically significant impact on quenching of star formation at high masses, while the quenching process in low-mass central galaxies is uncorrelated with halo formation history.},

The modelling includes a subgrid prescription for dusty star-forming regions, with both the subgrid obscuration of these regions and the fraction of metals in diffuse interstellar dust calibrated against far-infrared fluxes of local galaxies. The predicted optical colours as a function of stellar mass agree well with observation, with the skirt model showing marked improvement over a simple dust-screen model. The orientation dependence of attenuation is weaker than observed because eagle galaxies are generally puffier than real galaxies, due to the pressure floor imposed on the interstellar medium (ISM). The mock H {$\alpha$} luminosity function agrees reasonably well with the data, and we quantify the extent to which dust obscuration affects observed H {$\alpha$} fluxes. The distribution of D4000 break values is bimodal, as observed. In the simulation, 20 per cent of galaxies deemed 'passive' for the skirt model, I.e. exhibiting D4000 {$>$}1.8, are classified 'active' when ISM dust attenuation is not included. The fraction of galaxies with stellar mass greater than 1010 M{$\odot$} that are deemed passive is slightly smaller than observed, which is due to low levels of residual star formation in these simulated galaxies. Colour images, fluxes and spectra of eagle galaxies are to be made available through the public eagle data base.},

The relation is relatively steep from 108.5 to 1010.5 Msolar h-270, in good accord with known trends between luminosity and metallicity, but flattens above 1010.5 Msolar. We use indirect estimates of the gas mass based on the H{$\alpha$} luminosity to compare our data to predictions from simple closed box chemical evolution models. We show that metal loss is strongly anticorrelated with baryonic mass, with low-mass dwarf galaxies being 5 times more metal depleted than L* galaxies at z\textasciitilde 0.1. Evidence for metal depletion is not confined to dwarf galaxies but is found in galaxies with masses as high as 1010 Msolar. We interpret this as strong evidence of both the ubiquity of galactic winds and their effectiveness in removing metals from galaxy potential wells.},

Under the assumption of standard Navarro, Frenk, and White dark matter halos, a combination of lensing, dynamical, and stellar population synthesis models is used to disentangle the stellar and dark matter contribution for each lens. We define an "IMF mismatch" parameter {$\alpha\equiv$}M LD *,Ein/M SPS *,Ein as the ratio of stellar mass inferred by a joint lensing and dynamical model (M LD *,Ein) to the current stellar mass inferred from stellar populations synthesis models (M SPS *,Ein). We find that a Salpeter IMF provides stellar masses in agreement with those inferred by lensing and dynamical models (langlog {$\alpha$}rang = -0.00 {$\pm$} 0.03 {$\pm$} 0.02), while a Chabrier IMF underestimates them (langlog {$\alpha$}rang = 0.25 {$\pm$} 0.03 {$\pm$} 0.02). A tentative trend is found, in the sense that {$\alpha$} appears to increase with galaxy velocity dispersion. Taken at face value, this result would imply a non-universal IMF, perhaps dependent on metallicity, age, or abundance ratios of the stellar populations. Alternatively, the observed trend may imply non-universal dark matter halos with inner density slope increasing with velocity dispersion. While the degeneracy between the two interpretations cannot be broken without additional information, the data imply that massive early-type galaxies cannot have both a universal IMF and universal dark matter halos.

  abstract = {In the local Universe, there are a handful of dwarf compact star-forming galaxies with extremely low oxygen abundances. It has been proposed that they are young, having formed a large fraction of their stellar mass during their last few hundred Myr. However, little is known about the fraction of young stellar populations in more massive galaxies. In a previous article, we analysed 404 000 Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectra to identify a surprisingly large sample of more massive very young galaxies (VYGs), defined to have formed at least \$50\{\{\textbackslash{} \textbackslash rm per\textbackslash{} cent\}\}\$ of their stellar mass within the last 1 Gyr. Here, we investigate in detail the properties of a subsample of 207 galaxies that are VYGs according to all three of our spectral models. We compare their properties with those of control sample galaxies (CSGs). We find that VYGs tend to have higher surface brightness and to be more compact, dusty, asymmetric, and clumpy than CSGs. Analysis of a subsample with H I detections reveals that VYGs are more gas rich than CSGs. VYGs tend to reside more in the inner parts of low-mass groups and are twice as likely as CSGs to be interacting with a neighbour galaxy. On the other hand, VYGs and CSGs have similar gas metallicities and large-scale environments (relative to filaments and voids). These results suggest that gas-rich interactions and mergers are the main mechanisms responsible for the recent triggering of star formation in low-redshift VYGs, except for the lowest mass VYGs, where the starbursts would arise from a mixture of mergers and gas infall.},

The IMF is reasonably well constrained in the disk of the Milky Way but we have very little direct information on the form of the IMF in other galaxies and at earlier cosmic epochs. Here we report observations of the NaI doublet and the Wing-Ford molecular FeH band in the spectra of elliptical galaxies. These lines are strong in stars with masses less than 0.3Msolar (where Msolar is the mass of the Sun) and are weak or absent in all other types of stars. We unambiguously detect both signatures, consistent with previous studies that were based on data of lower signal-to-noise ratio. The direct detection of the light of low-mass stars implies that they are very abundant in elliptical galaxies, making up over 80\% of the total number of stars and contributing more than 60\% of the total stellar mass. We infer that the IMF in massive star-forming galaxies in the early Universe produced many more low-mass stars than the IMF in the Milky Way disk, and was probably slightly steeper than the Salpeter form in the mass range 0.1Msolar to 1Msolar.},

  abstract = {We present the Cosmology and Astrophysics with MachinE Learning Simulations --CAMELS-- project. CAMELS is a suite of 4,233 cosmological simulations of \$(25\textasciitilde h\^\{-1\}\{\textbackslash rm Mpc\})\^3\$ volume each: 2,184 state-of-the-art (magneto-)hydrodynamic simulations run with the AREPO and GIZMO codes, employing the same baryonic subgrid physics as the IllustrisTNG and SIMBA simulations, and 2,049 N-body simulations. The goal of the CAMELS project is to provide theory predictions for different observables as a function of cosmology and astrophysics, and it is the largest suite of cosmological (magneto-)hydrodynamic simulations designed to train machine learning algorithms. CAMELS contains thousands of different cosmological and astrophysical models by way of varying \$\textbackslash Omega\_m\$, \$\textbackslash sigma\_8\$, and four parameters controlling stellar and AGN feedback, following the evolution of more than 100 billion particles and fluid elements over a combined volume of \$(400\textasciitilde h\^\{-1\}\{\textbackslash rm Mpc\})\^3\$. We describe the simulations in detail and characterize the large range of conditions represented in terms of the matter power spectrum, cosmic star formation rate density, galaxy stellar mass function, halo baryon fractions, and several galaxy scaling relations. We show that the IllustrisTNG and SIMBA suites produce roughly similar distributions of galaxy properties over the full parameter space but significantly different halo baryon fractions and baryonic effects on the matter power spectrum. This emphasizes the need for marginalizing over baryonic effects to extract the maximum amount of information from cosmological surveys. We illustrate the unique potential of CAMELS using several machine learning applications, including non-linear interpolation, parameter estimation, symbolic regression, data generation with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.},

  abstract = {We introduce the Illustris Project, a series of large-scale  hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation. The highest resolution simulation, Illustris-1, covers a volume of (106.5 Mpc)3, has a dark mass resolution of 6.26 \texttimes{} 106 M{$\odot$}, and an initial baryonic matter mass resolution of 1.26 \texttimes{} 106 M{$\odot$}. At z = 0 gravitational forces are softened on scales of 710 pc, and the smallest hydrodynamical gas cells have an extent of 48 pc. We follow the dynamical evolution of 2 \texttimes{} 18203 resolution elements and in addition passively evolve 18203 Monte Carlo tracer particles reaching a total particle count of more than 18 billion. The galaxy formation model includes: primordial and metal-line cooling with self-shielding corrections, stellar evolution, stellar feedback, gas recycling, chemical enrichment, supermassive black hole growth, and feedback from active galactic nuclei. Here we describe the simulation suite, and contrast basic predictions of our model for the present-day galaxy population with observations of the local universe. At z = 0 our simulation volume contains about 40 000 well-resolved galaxies covering a diverse range of morphologies and colours including early-type, late-type and irregular galaxies. The simulation reproduces reasonably well the cosmic star formation rate density, the galaxy luminosity function, and baryon conversion efficiency at z = 0. It also qualitatively captures the impact of galaxy environment on the red fractions of galaxies. The internal velocity structure of selected well-resolved disc galaxies obeys the stellar and baryonic Tully-Fisher relation together with flat circular velocity curves. In the well-resolved regime, the simulation reproduces the observed mix of early-type and late-type galaxies. Our model predicts a halo mass dependent impact of baryonic effects on the halo mass function and the masses of haloes caused by feedback from supernova and active galactic nuclei.},

In the data analysis of galaxy surveys, the precision of the statistical measurement is primarily limited by the cosmic variance on large scales. Fortunately, this limitation can in principle be mitigated by observing multiple types of biased tracers. In this brief review, we present the idea of the multi-tracer method, outline key steps in the data analysis and show several worked examples based on the GAMA, BOSS and eBOSS galaxy surveys. This work is a part of a special issue dedicated to the 20th anniversary of RAA (2001-2020), which is prefaced in Wang \& Ip (2020)},

Surprisingly, we find that at the present epoch it is virtually impossible to establish a unique calibration of UBVRIJHKL colours in terms of stellar metallicity [Fe/H] which is consistent simultaneously with both colour-temperature relations and colour-absolute magnitude diagrams (CMDs) based on observed globular cluster photometry data and on published, currently popular standard stellar evolutionary tracks and isochrones. The problem appears to be related to the long-standing incompleteness in our understanding of convection in late-type stellar evolution, but is also due to a serious lack of relevant observational calibration data that would help resolve, or at least further significant progress towards resolving this issue. In view of the most important applications of the BaSeL library, we here propose two different metallicity calibration versions: (1) the ``WLBC 99'' library, which consistently matches empirical colour-temperature relations and which, therefore, should make an ideal tool for the study of individual stars; and (2), the ``PADOVA 2000'' library, which provides isochrones from the Padova 2000 grid (Girardi et al. \textbackslash cite\{padova\}) that successfully reproduce Galactic globular-cluster colour-absolute magnitude diagrams and which thus should prove particularly useful for studies of collective phenomena in stellar populations in clusters and galaxies.},

  abstract = {Satellite galaxies in groups and clusters are more likely to have low  star formation rates (SFRs) and lie on the `red sequence' than central (`field') galaxies. Using galaxy group/cluster catalogues from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7, together with a high-resolution, cosmological N-body simulation to track satellite orbits, we examine the star formation histories and quenching time-scales of satellites of Mstar {$>$} 5 \texttimes{} 109 M{$\odot$} at z {$\approx$} 0. We first explore satellite infall histories: group preprocessing and ejected orbits are critical aspects of satellite evolution, and properly accounting for these, satellite infall typically occurred at z \texttildelow{} 0.5, or \texttildelow 5 Gyr ago. To obtain accurate initial conditions for the SFRs of satellites at their time of first infall, we construct an empirical parametrization for the evolution of central galaxy SFRs and quiescent fractions. With this, we constrain the importance and efficiency of satellite quenching as a function of satellite and host halo mass, finding that satellite quenching is the dominant process for building up all quiescent galaxies at Mstar {$<$} 1010 M{$\odot$}. We then constrain satellite star formation histories, finding a `delayed-then-rapid' quenching scenario: satellite SFRs evolve unaffected for 2-4 Gyr after infall, after which star formation quenches rapidly, with an e-folding time of {$<$}0.8 Gyr. These quenching time-scales are shorter for more massive satellites but do not depend on host halo mass: the observed increase in the satellite quiescent fraction with halo mass arises simply because of satellites quenching in a lower mass group prior to infall (group preprocessing), which is responsible for up to half of quenched satellites in massive clusters. Because of the long time delay before quenching starts, satellites experience significant stellar mass growth after infall, nearly identical to central galaxies. This fact provides key physical insight into the subhalo abundance matching method.},

We measure the local relation from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the intermediate redshift relation from the Smithsonian Hectospec Lensing Survey. Both samples are highly complete ({$>$}85\%) and we consistently measure the stellar mass and velocity dispersion for the two samples. The M * {$\sigma$} relation and its scatter are independent of redshift with {$\sigma$} \textbackslash propto \{M\}* 0.3 for M * {$\greaterequivlnt$} 1010.3 M {$\odot$}. The measured slope of the M * {$\sigma$} relation is the same as the scaling between the total halo mass and the dark matter halo velocity dispersion obtained by N-body simulations. This consistency suggests that massive quiescent galaxies are virialized systems, where the central dark matter concentration is either a constant or negligible fraction of the stellar mass. The relation between the total galaxy mass (stellar + dark matter) and the central stellar velocity dispersion is consistent with the observed relation between the total mass of a galaxy cluster and the velocity dispersion of the cluster members. This result suggests that the central stellar velocity dispersion is directly proportional to the velocity dispersion of the dark matter halo. Thus, the central stellar velocity dispersion is a fundamental, directly observable property of galaxies, which may robustly connect galaxies to dark matter halos in N-body simulations. To interpret the results further in the context of {$\Lambda$}CDM, it would be useful to analyze the relationship between the velocity dispersion of stellar particles and the velocity dispersion characterizing their dark matter halos in high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamic simulations.},

  abstract = {The mapping between the distributions of the observed galaxy stellar  mass and the underlying dark matter haloes provides the crucial link from theories of large-scale structure formation to interpreting the complex phenomena of galaxy formation and evolution. We develop a novel statistical method, based on the halo occupation distribution (HOD) model, to solve for this mapping by jointly fitting the galaxy clustering and the galaxy-galaxy lensing from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The method, called the iHOD model, extracts maximum information from the survey by including \texttildelow 80 per cent more galaxies than the traditional HOD methods, accounting for the incompleteness of the stellar mass samples self-consistently. The derived stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) explains the clustering and lensing of SDSS galaxies over four decades in stellar mass, while successfully predicting the observed stellar mass functions (SMFs). By modelling significantly more galaxies, the iHOD breaks the degeneracy between the logarithmic scatter in the stellar mass at fixed halo mass and the slope of the mean SHMR at high masses, without assuming a strong prior on the scatter and/or using the SMF as an input. We detect a decline of the scatter with halo mass, from 0.22\_\{-0.01\}\^\{+0.02\} dex below 1012 h-1 M{$\odot$} to 0.18 {$\pm$} 0.01 dex at 1014 h-1 M{$\odot$}. The model predicts a departure of satellite SMFs from the Schechter form in massive haloes and a linear scaling of satellite number with halo mass. The iHOD model can be easily applied to other spectroscopic data sets, greatly improving statistical constraints on the SHMR compared to traditional HOD methods within the same survey.},

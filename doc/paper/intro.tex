\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro} 
% galaxy evolution with big data 
Large galaxy surveys have been transformational for our understanding of galaxy
evolution. 
With surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey~\citep[SDSS][]{york2000},
Galaxy and Mass Assembly survey~\citep[GAMA][]{driver2011}, and 
PRIsm MUlti-object Survey~\citep[PRIMUS][]{coil2011}, 
we have now established the global trends of galaxies in the local universe. 
For instance, population statistiscs, such as the stellar mass
function~\citep{} or quiescent fraction~\citep{}, and their evolution are now 
well understood. 
Many global scaling relations of galaxy propreties such as the mass-metallicity
relation~\citep{} or
the ``star formation sequence'' of star forming galaxies~\citep{} have also
been firmly established by these observations. 
However, despite their importance in building our current understanding, these
empirical relations on their own do not directly shed light on how galaxies
form and evolve. 
%we've exhausted what we can do with the empirical relations of our current
%observations

Measuring the empirical relations with more precision and accuracy can
potentially reveal new nuanced trends among galaxies undetectable by previous
observations.
There are also new approaches that go beyond the observed relations.
Empirical prescriptions for physical proceses can be placed on top of $N$-body
simulations that capture hierarchical structure formation in empirical 
models~\citep[\emph{e.g.} {\sc UniverseMachine}][]{behroozi2019}. 
The predictions of these models can be compared to the observed distributions
of galaxy properties to derive insights into physical processes, such as the
timescale of star formation quenching~\citep{wetzel2013, hahn2017, tinker2017}. 
Predicted distributions of galaxy properties of large-scale cosmological 
hydrodyanmical simulations can also be compared to 
observations~\citep[\emph{e.g.}][]{genel2014, somerville2015, dave2017,
trayford2017, donnari2020, dickey2021}.
%(e.g., Genel et al. 2014; Torrey et al. 2014; Vogelsberger et al. 2014; Schaye et al. 2015; Somerville & Dav ́e 2015; Sparre et al. 2015; Dav ́e et al. 2017; Pillepich et al. 2018a; Nel- son et al. 2018; Trayford et al. 2017; Donnari et al. 2019, 2020a,b).
Advances in machine learning techniques for accelerating and emulating
hydrodynamical simulations~\citep{} will enable such comparisons to explore a
broad range of galaxy formation models.
Soon we will be able to compare detailed galaxy formation models directly
against observations and explore the parameter spaces of the models. 
What all of these approaches share is that they require more statistically
poweful galaxy samples with well controlled systematics and well understood
selection function. 

The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) marks the next stage in large
galaxy surveys. 
Over the next five years, DESI will use its 5000 robotically-actuated fibers to
provide redshifts of ${\sim}30$ million galaxies over 
${\sim}14,000~{\rm deg}^2$, a third of the sky~\citep{desicollaboration2016,
desicollaboration2016a}.
The redshifts will be spectroscopically measured from optical spectra that
spans the wavelength range $3600 < \lambda < 9800\AA$ with spectral resolutions
$R = \lambda/\Delta \lambda = 2000 - 5000$.
In addition, DESI targets will also have photometry from the Legacy Imaging
Surveys Data Release 9~\citep[LS][]{dey2019}, used for target selection. 
LS is a combination of three public projects (Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey,
Beijing-Arizona Sky Survey, and Mayall $z$-band Legacy Survey) that jointly
imaged the DESI footprint in three optical bands ($g$, $r$, and $z$). 
It also includes photometry in the \emph{Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer}
$W1$, $W2$, $W3$, and $W4$ infrared bands.
The infrared photometry is derived from all imaging through year 4 of
NEOWISE-Reactivation force-photometered in the unWISE maps at the locations of
LS optical sources~\citep{meisner2017, meisner2017a}.

    DESI will conduct the largest spectroscopic survey to date covering

    galaxies, emission line galaxies, and quasars out to $z > 3$.
    During bright time, DESI will measure the spectra of ${\sim}10$ million
    galaxies out to $z{\sim}0.6$ with the Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS).
    {\em Left}: BGS (blue) will cover ${\sim}2\times$ the SDSS footprint

    by the MXXL simulation (blue).  
    We include the redshift distribution of SDSS (orange) and GAMA multiplied
    by $10\times$ (red) for comparison. 
    BGS will be two orders of magnitude deeper than the SDSS main galaxy sample
    and deeper than GAMA.
    BGS will provide spectra for a magnitude limited sample of ${\sim}10$
    million galaxies down to $r < 19.5$ (BGS Bright) and a deeper sample of
    ${\sim 4}$ million galaxies as faint as $r < 20.175$ (BGS Faint).

During bright time, when the night sky is roughly ${\sim}2.5\times$ brighter
than the nominal dark codntions, DESI will conduct the Bright Galaxy Survey
(BGS). 
BGS will provide a $r < 19.5$ magnitude-limited sample of ${\sim}10$ million
galaxies out to redshift $z < 0.6$ --- the BGS bright sample. 
It will also provide a surface brightness and color selected sample of 
${\sim}5$ million faint galaxies with $19.5 < r < 20.175$. 
The completeness and effect of systematics of the BGS galaxy samples are
characterized in detail in Hahn~\etal~(in prep.) using observations from
DESI Survey Validation. 
%From the BGS galaxy samples we will be able to measure the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation to the cosmic variance limit. 
%They also have the potential to unlock the constraining power of galaxy clustering with higher-order statistics and multiple-tracer methods~\citep{desicollaboration2016, desicollaboration2016a}.
%Beyond cosmology, BGS will be transformative for galaxy evolution. 
Compared to the seminal SDSS main galaxy survey, BGS will provide optical
spectra two magnitudes deeper, over twice the sky, and ${\sim}4$ billion years
farther (Figure~\ref{fig:bgs}). 
It will observe a broader range of galaxies than previous surveys with
unprecendented statistical power. 
Hence, BGS offers a unique opportunity to apply more sophisticated statistical
analyses and new approaches to reveal the detailed connections among galaxy
populations and  advance galaxy evolution studies.

        We include the $M_*$ distribution of MXXL galaxies with $r < 20$ (blue)
        for reference.
        Many such fainter galaxies will be included in the BGS Faint sample,
        which will observe galaxies as faint as $r < 20.175$. 
        BGS will observe a wide range of galaxies with high completeness and
        unprecedented statistical power.

        galaxy evolution studies.}}\label{fig:bgs_mstar}

Observations alone, however, are not sufficient.  
New techniques and approaches require robust and consistent measuremnts of
galaxy properties from the observations.
The many advantages of the BGS observations would be squandered if they were 
analyzed inconsistently with a hodgepodge of methodologies.  
Value-added catalogs (VACs) that provide consistently measured galaxy
properties for entire galaxy surveys are instrumental in this regard and have
been used by hundreds of scientific
analyses~\citep[see][for a review]{blanton2009}. 
For SDSS galaxies, the NYU-VAGC~\citep{blanton2005} provides photometric properties
(\emph{e.g.} absolute magnitudes) and the MPA-JHU
catalog~~\citep{brinchmann2004}\footnote{https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/SDSS/DR7/}
provides spectral properties (\emph{e.g.} emission line
luminosities).
Despite being released over a decade ago, these VACs are still widely used
today~\citep[\emph{e.g.}][]{alpaslan2021, odonnell2021, trevisan2021}. 
Accompanying the BGS observations, the DESI Galaxy Quasar Physics working group
will produce the PRObabilistic Valued-Added Bright Galaxy Survey (PROVABGS)
catalog. 
PROVABGS will exploit the latest developments to infer galaxy properties from
DESI observations and maximize the scientific impact of BGS. 

For all ${\sim}10$ million BGS galaxies, PROVABGS will provide full posterior
probability distributions of physical properties such as stellar mass ($M_*$),
star formation rate (SFR), metallicity, and stellar age. 
These properties will be inferred from both the LS photometry and DESI
spectroscopy using a state-of-the-art Bayesian modeling of the galaxy spectral
energy distribution (SED). 
With these properties, PROVABGS will enable direct extension of previous works
to the more complete and statistically powerful spectroscopic galaxy sample. 
For instance, $M_*$ values will be used to measure the stellar mass function
down to \todo{$M_* \sim 10^{8}M_\odot$} (Hahn\etal~in prep.). 
$M_*$ and SFR will also be used to more precisely measure the star forming
sequence.
Detailed galaxy environment studies will be 

Moreover, instead of point estimates of galaxy properties, PROVABGS will
provide full posterior distributions.

powerful sample that will require}

%Increasingly sophisticated statistical studies of the overall population of galaxies as a function of mass, cosmic time, and environment have provided a basic picture of the formation and evolution of galaxies

\todo{Why do we need a mock challenge? i.e. what are the goals of this paper?}
We want to test and cement our methodology specifically for our GQP 
analysis before SV data comes out. 
As part of the survey preparation, we have all the tools to accurately 
forward model observations. 
\todo{details on some of the specific tools and what we're able to simulate: 
realistic spectroscopy. realistic photometry. realistic spectro-photometry} 
All of this gives us a rare opportunity to test our methodology on bespoke
simulations. 

\todo{overview of the paper} 
A mock challenge is also great for testing new methodology.
BGS is a bright time survey and will push the boundaries of low SNR 
spectra. But if we can find a way to  infer robust galaxy properties the 
statistical payout is awesome. \todo{Something also about LRGs} 
We're also trying to robustly fit spectra and photometry simultaneously. 
This has been done before (\todo{citations}) but not extensively tested 
on simulations.

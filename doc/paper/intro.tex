\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro} 
% galaxy evolution with big data 
Large galaxy surveys have been transformational for our understanding of galaxy
evolution. 
With surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey~\citep[SDSS;][]{york2000},
Galaxy and Mass Assembly survey~\citep[GAMA;][]{driver2011}, and 
PRIsm MUlti-object Survey~\citep[PRIMUS;][]{coil2011}, 
we have now established the global trends of galaxies in the local universe. 
Population statistiscs, such as the stellar mass 
function~\citep{li2009, marchesini2009, moustakas2013} or quiescent
fraction~\citep{kauffmann2003a, blanton2003, baldry2006, taylor2009}, and their
evolution are now well understood. 
Many global scaling relations of galaxy propreties such as the mass-metallicity
relation~\citep{tremonti2004} or
the ``star formation sequence''~\citep{noeske2007, daddi2007,
salim2007} have
also been firmly established. 
Despite their importance in building our current understanding, however,
the empirical relations from existing observations are inadequate for
shedding further light on how galaxies form and evolve.

More precise and accurate measurements have the potential to reveal new trends
among galaxies undetected by previous observations.
So do new approaches that go beyond observed relations.
Empirical prescriptions for physical processes can be combined with $N$-body
simulations that capture hierarchical structure formation in empirical 
models~\citep[\emph{e.g.} {\sc UniverseMachine};][]{behroozi2019}. 
The predictions of these models can be compared to the observed distributions
of galaxy properties to derive insights into physical processes, such as the
timescale of star formation quenching~\citep{wetzel2013, hahn2017, tinker2017}. 
Predicted distributions of galaxy properties of large-scale cosmological 
hydrodyanmical simulations can also be compared to 
observations~\citep[\emph{e.g.}][]{genel2014, somerville2015a, dave2017a,
trayford2017, dickey2021, donnari2021}.
Though such comparisons are currently limited by the computation of costs of
simulations, advances in machine learning techniques for accelerating and
emulating simulations will enable such comparisons to explore a broad range of
galaxy formation models~\citep[\emph{e.g.}][]{villaescusa-navarro2021}.
Soon we will be able to compare detailed galaxy formation models directly
against observations and explore the parameter spaces and physical
prescriptions of the models. 
While many different approaches are available for expanding our understanding
of galaxies, they all require more statistically powerful galaxy samples with
well controlled systematics and well understood selection functions. 

Better observations, however, must be accompanied by better and more consistent
methodogy. 
The statistical power of large galaxy surveys are squandered when they are
analyzed inconsistently with a hodgepodge of methodologies since analyses
cannot take advantage of new techniques and approaches. 
In this regard, value-added catalogs (VACs) that provide consistently measured
galaxy properties for entire galaxy surveys are instrumental and have been
used by hundreds of galaxy studies~\citep[see][for a review]{blanton2009}.
For SDSS galaxies, the NYU-VAGC~\citep{blanton2005} provided photometric
properties (\emph{e.g.} absolute magnitudes) and the MPA-JHU
catalog~~\citep{brinchmann2004}\footnote{https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/SDSS/DR7/}
provided spectral properties (\emph{e.g.} emission line luminosities).
Despite being released over a decade ago, these VACs are still widely used
today~\citep[\emph{e.g.}][]{alpaslan2021, odonnell2021, trevisan2021}. 

% motivate the probabilistic approach
Probabilistic VACs are the next advancement in VACs that will extract even more
the information from galaxy surveys. 
Unlike previous VACs that provide point estimates and rough estimates of
uncertainties, probabilistic catalogs provide full posterior distributions of
galaxy properties --- $p(\theta\given{\bfi X_i})$, the probability of galaxy
properties $\theta$ given observations, ${\bfi X_i}$, of galaxy $i$.
Posteriors offer more accurate measurements of galaxy properties because they
estimate the uncertainties and any degeneracies among them more accurately. 
They also open the doors for principled population inference.
Given observations of a set of galaxies, $\{{\bfi X_i}\}$, we can combine
individual posteriors of the galaxies to rigorously derive the distribution of
their physical properties: $p(\theta | \{ {\bfi X_i} \})$.
For example, we can use posteriors on stellar mass, $M_*$, and star formation
rate, SFR, to infer $p(M_*, {\rm SFR} | \{ {\bfi X_i} \})$. 
From the $M_*$-SFR distributions, we can measure the intrinsic width star
formation sequence with unprecedented accuracy and provide key insight into
star formation and stellar and AGN feedback in star-forming
galaxies~\citep[\emph{e.g.}][]{davies2021, curtis-lake2021}.

With probabilistic catalogs, we can also include galaxies with less
tightly constrained properties in our analyses since posteriors accurately
quantify uncertainties. 
This means we can probe less explored, low signal-to-noise, regimes that may
shed new light on galaxy evolution, such as dwarf galaxies.
We can also more reliably quantify the fraction of extreme or outlier
galaxies, \emph{e.g.} quiescent fraction of field dwarf
galaxies~\citep{geha2012}.
Probabilistic catalogs also open the door for Bayesian Hierarchical approaches
and improve the statistical power of BGS through Bayesian shrinkage: the joint
posterior of the galaxy sample can be used as the prior to shrink the
uncertainties on the properties of individual galaxies. 
Overall, probabilistic VACs will enable a new level of statistical robustness
in galaxy studies and more fully extract the statistical power of galaxy surveys.

The PRObabilistic Value-Added Bright Galaxy Survey (PROVABGS) catalog will be a
probabilistic VAC constructed from next pivotal large galaxy survey: the Dark
Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI).
%In this work, we present the methodologies that will be used to construct the PRObabilistic Value-Added Bright Galaxy Survey (PROVABGS) catalog from the next pivotal large galaxy survey, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS).
%The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) marks the next stage in large galaxy surveys. 
Over the next five years, DESI will use its 5000 robotically-actuated fibers to
provide redshifts of ${\sim}30$ million galaxies over 
${\sim}14,000~{\rm deg}^2$, a third of the sky~\citep{desicollaboration2016,
desicollaboration2016a}.
The redshifts will be spectroscopically measured from optical spectra that
spans the wavelength range $3600 < \lambda < 9800\AA$ with spectral resolutions
$R = \lambda/\Delta \lambda = 2000 - 5000$.
In addition, DESI targets will also have photometry from the Legacy Imaging
Surveys Data Release 9~\citep[LS;][]{dey2019}, used for target selection. 
LS is a combination of three public projects (Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey,
Beijing-Arizona Sky Survey, and Mayall $z$-band Legacy Survey) that jointly
imaged the DESI footprint in three optical bands ($g$, $r$, and $z$). 
It also includes photometry in the \emph{Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer}
$W1$, $W2$, $W3$, and $W4$ infrared bands.
The infrared photometry is derived from all imaging through year 4 of
NEOWISE-Reactivation force-photometered in the unWISE maps at the locations of
LS optical sources~\citep{meisner2017a, meisner2017}.

    DESI will conduct the largest spectroscopic survey to date covering
    ${\sim}14,000~{\rm deg}^2$. 
    During dark time, DESI will measure ${>}20$ million spectra of luminous red
    galaxies, emission line galaxies, and quasars out to $z > 3$.
    During bright time, DESI will measure the spectra of ${\sim}10$ million
    galaxies out to $z{\sim}0.6$ with the Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS).
    {\em Left}: BGS (blue) will cover ${\sim}2\times$ the SDSS footprint
    (orange) and ${\sim}45\times$ the GAMA footprint (red).
    {\em Right}: We present the redshift distribution of BGS as predicted by
    the Millenium-XXL simulation~\citep[blue;][]{smith2017}. 
    We include the redshift distribution of SDSS and GAMA multiplied by
    $10\times$ for comparison. 
    BGS will be roughly two orders of magnitude deeper than the SDSS main
    galaxy sample and 0.375 mag deeper than GAMA.
    BGS will provide spectra for a magnitude limited sample of ${\sim}10$
    million galaxies down to $r < 19.5$ (BGS Bright) and a deeper sample of
    ${\sim 5}$ million galaxies as faint as $r < 20.175$ (BGS Faint).

During bright time, when the night sky is ${\sim}2.5\times$ brighter than
nominal dark conditions, DESI will conduct the Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS).
BGS will provide a $r < 19.5$ magnitude-limited sample of ${\sim}10$ million
galaxies out to redshift $z < 0.6$ --- the BGS Bright sample. 
It will also provide a surface brightness and color-selected sample of 
${\sim}5$ million faint galaxies with $19.5 < r < 20.175$ --- the BGS Faint
sample. 
The selection and completeness as well as the effect of systematics of the BGS
samples are characterized in detail in Hahn~\etal~(in prep.). 
Compared to the seminal SDSS main galaxy survey, BGS will provide optical
spectra two magnitudes deeper, over twice the sky, and double the median
redshift $z{\sim}0.2$ (Figure~\ref{fig:bgs}). 
It will observe a broader range of galaxies than previous surveys with
unprecendented statistical power. 
%BGS presents a unique opportunity to apply more sophisticated statistical analyses and new approaches to reveal the detailed connections among galaxy populations and  advance galaxy evolution studies.

        We include the $M_*$ distribution of MXXL galaxies with $r < 20$ (blue)
        for reference.
        Many such fainter galaxies will be included in the BGS Faint sample,
        which will observe galaxies as faint as $r < 20.175$. 
        BGS will observe a broad range of galaxies with high completeness and
        provide galaxy samples with unprecedented statistical power.
        This includes a large sample of <$10^9M_\odot$ dwarf galaxies. %, which will produce tests of dark matter physics and galaxy physics.

        catalog, which will unlock more sophisticated statistical approaches to

%Better observations alone, however, are not sufficient.  
%The many advantages of BGS observations would be squandered if they were
%analyzed inconsistently with a hodgepodge of methodologies.  
%The advantages of new techniques and approaches cannot be realized without
%consistently measured galaxy properties. 
%Value-added catalogs (VACs) that provide consistently measured galaxy
%properties for entire galaxy surveys are instrumental in this regard and have
%been used by hundreds of galaxy studies~\citep[see][for a review]{blanton2009}.
%For SDSS galaxies, the NYU-VAGC~\citep{blanton2005} provided photometric
%properties (\emph{e.g.} absolute magnitudes) and the MPA-JHU
%catalog~~\citep{brinchmann2004}\footnote{https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/SDSS/DR7/}
%provided spectral properties (\emph{e.g.} emission line luminosities).
%Despite being released over a decade ago, these VACs are still widely used
%today~\citep[\emph{e.g.}][]{alpaslan2021, odonnell2021, trevisan2021}. 
%Accompanying the BGS observations, the DESI Galaxy Quasar Physics (GQP) working
%group will produce the PRObabilistic Valued-Added Bright Galaxy Survey
%(PROVABGS) catalog. 

For all ${>}10$ million BGS galaxies, PROVABGS will provide full posterior
probability distributions of physical properties such as $M_*$, SFR,
metallicity ($Z$), and stellar age ($t_{\rm age}$). 
These properties will be inferred from both the LS photometry and DESI
spectroscopy using a state-of-the-art Bayesian modeling of the galaxy spectral
energy distribution (SED). 
PROVABGS will enable conventional analyses to be extended to a more
statistically powerful spectroscopic galaxy sample. 
Population statistics such as the stellar mass function or the star formation
sequence will be measured with higher precision than previously possible and
over a much wider range of galaxies (Figure~\ref{fig:bgs_mstar}). 
In particular, with the faint apparent magnitude limit of BGS ($r < 20.175$),
PROVABGS will include low mass (<$10^9M_\odot$) dwarf populations, which
provide important probes of the physics of dark matter and star formation
feedback.
The high completeness and simple selection function of the BGS Bright sample
will also facilitate comparisons to empirical models or cosmological galaxy 
formation simulations with novel approaches. 

%Moreover, PROVABGS will provide more accurate measurements of galaxy properties
%from full posterior distributions, rather than point estimates. 
%Posteriors estimate the uncertainties on galaxy property measurements and any
%degeneracies among them more accurately. 
%This will enable a new level of statistical robustness in galaxy evolution
%studies.
%For instance, we can combine individual posteriors of galaxies to conduct
%principled population inference.
%Given observations of a set of galaxies, $\{X_i\}$, we can properly derive the
%distribution of their physical properties, $\theta$ --- $p(\theta | \{ X_i \})$
%--- and \emph{fully exploit the observations} 
%This also means that we can robustly include galaxies with less tightly
%constrained properties.  
%Little explored low signal-to-noise regimes that can be probed with this
%approach may shed new light on galaxy evolution.
%The PROVABGS posteriors will also open the door for Bayesian Hierarchical
%approaches and improve the statistical power of BGS through Bayesian shrinkage:
%the joint posterior of the galaxy sample can be used as the prior to shrink the
%uncertainties on the properties of individual galaxies. 
%With these advantages, PROVABGS will provide a VAC that fully exploits the
%DESI observations and maximizes the scientific impact of BGS. 

In this paper, we present the mock challenge for PROVABGS conducted by the DESI
Galaxy Quasar Physics working group. 
We present the state-of-the-art SED modeling that will be used to infer the
galaxy properties of BGS galaxies and construct the PROVABGS. 
We use an SED model with non-parametric prescriptions for galaxy star formation
and metallicity histories and accelerate the parameter inference using neural
emulators. 
Moreover, we validate our SED modeling on realistic mock BGS observations
constructed using the {\sc L-Galaxies} semi-analytic
model~\citep{henriques2015} and DESI survey simulations. 
By applying our SED model on mock observations, where we know the true galaxy
properties, we demonstrate that we can accurately infer galaxy properties for
PROVABGS and highlight the advantages of jointly analyzing photometry and
spectra. 
Furthermore, we characterize, in detail, the limits of our SED modeling so
that future studies using PROVABGS can use this work as a reference in
interpreting their results. 

In Section~\ref{sec:sims}, we describe the {\sc L-Galaxies} semi-analytic model
and how we use them to construct synthetic BGS observations. 
We then present the SED model, our Bayesian parameter inference framework with
neural emulators, and the mock challenge in Section~\ref{sec:methods}. 
We present the results of the mock challenge in Section~\ref{sec:results} and
discuss their implications in Section~\ref{sec:discuss}.

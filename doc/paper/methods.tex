\section{Joint SED modeling of Photometry and Spectra} \label{sec:methods}
\subsection{Stellar Population Synthesis Modeling} \label{sec:sps} 
PROVABGS will provide galaxy properties inferred from joint SED modeling of
DESI photometry and spectra. 
For the SED modeling, we use a state-of-the-art stellar population synthesis
(SPS) model that uses a non-parametric SFH with a starburst, a non-parametric
ZH that varies with time, and a flexible dust attenuation prescription. 

% describe SFH prescription
The form of the SFH is one of the most important factors in the accuracy of an
SPS model.
In general, the form of the SFH requires balancing between being flexible enough
to describe the wide range of SFHs in observations while not being too flexible
that it can describe any SFH at the expense of constraining power.  
If the model SFH is not flexible enough to describe actual SFHs of galaxies,
then unbiased galaxy properties cannot be inferred using the SPS model. 
For instance, most SPS models~(\emph{e.g.} CIGALE,~\citealt{serra2011,
boquien2019}; BAGPIPES,~\citealt{carnall2018}) use parametric SFH such as the
exponentially declining $\tau$-model.
Such functional forms, however, produce biased estimates of galaxy properties
(\emph{e.g.} $M_*$ and SFR) when used to fit mock observations of simulated 
galaxies~\citep{simha2014, pacifici2015, ciesla2017, carnall2018}.
On the other hand, many non-parametric forms of the SFH are overly flexible
and allow unphysical SFHs~\citep{leja2019}, which unncessarily increases 
parameter degeneracies and discards constraining power. 

In our SPS model, we use a non-parametric SFH with two components: one based on
non-negative matrix factorization~\citep[NMF;][]{lee1999,cichocki2009,
fevotte2011} basis functions and a starburst component.
For the first component, SFH is a linear combination of four NMF SFH bases:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:nmf} 
    {\rm SFH}^{\rm NMF} (t, t_{\rm age}) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{4} \beta_i
    \frac{s_i^{\rm SFH}(t)}{\int\limits_0^{t_{\rm age}} s_i^{\rm SFH}(t) \,
    {\rm d}t}. 
\end{equation} 
$\{s^{\rm SFH}_i\}$ are the NMF basis functions and $\{\beta_i\}$ are the
coefficients. 
The integral in the denominator normalizes the NMF basis functions to unity. 
We constrain $\sum_i \beta_i = 1$, so the total SFH of the component over the
age of the galaxy ($t_{\rm age})$ is normalized to unity.
$\{s^{\rm SFH}_i\}$ are derived from the Illustris cosmological hydrodynamic
simulation~\citep{vogelsberger2014, genel2014, nelson2015}.
We compile, rebin, and smooth the SFHs of Illustris galaxies and then perform
NMF on them to derive $\{s^{\rm SFH}_i\}$. 
We find that 4 components is sufficient to accurately reconstruct the SFHs
from Illustris. 
We present the NMF SFH bases as a function of lookback time in
left panel of Figure~\ref{fig:nmf}.
By using NMF instead of \emph{e.g.} Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we
ensure that all of the SFH bases are non-negative and, thus, physically
meaningful. 
For further details on the derivation of the NMF bases, we refer readers to
Appendix~\ref{sec:nmf}. 
Assuming that the SFHs of Illustris galaxies resemble the SFHs of real
galaxies, our NMF form provides a compact and flexible representation of the
SFHs. 

The NMF basis functions are derived from smooth SFHs, which means that it does
not include any stochasticity. 
However, observations and high resolution zoom-in hydrodyanmical simulations
both find significant stochasticity in galaxy SFHs~\citep{sparre2017,
caplar2019, hahn2019b, iyer2020}. 
To include stochasticity in our SPS model, we include a starburst component
that consists of a SSP. 
Thus, for the total SFH, we use
\begin{equation} \label{eq:sfh}
    {\rm SFH} (t, t_{\rm age}) = (1 - f_{\rm burst})~{\rm SFH}^{\rm NMF} (t,
    t_{\rm age}) + f_{\rm burst}~\delta_{\rm D}(t - t_{\rm burst}).
\end{equation}
$f_{\rm burst}$ is the fraction of total stellar mass formed during the
starburst; $t_{\rm burst}$ is the time at which the starburst occurs; 
$\delta_{\rm D}$ is the Dirac delta function.
In total we use 6 free parameters in our SFH: 4 NMF basis coefficients 
($\beta_i$), $f_{\rm burst}$, and $t_{\rm burst}$. 

% describe ZH 
Another key part of an SPS model is the chemical enrichment history, or ZH. 
Current SPS models mostly assume a flat ZH, constant metallicity over
time~\citep{carnall2019a, leja2019}.
Since galaxies do not have constant metallicities throughout their history,
this assumption can significantly bias the inferred galaxy
properties~\citep{thorne2021}. 
Instead, we take a similar approach to the SFH and use NMF basis functions for
ZH:
\begin{equation}
    {\rm ZH}(t) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^2 \gamma_i s_i^{\rm ZH}(t).
\end{equation} 
$\{s_i^{\rm ZH}(t)\}$ are the ZH NMF basis functions and $\{\gamma_i\}$ are the
coefficients. 
$\{s_i^{\rm ZH}(t)\}$ are fit using the ZHs of simulated galaxies from
Illustris in the same fashion as the SFH. 
In the right panel of Figure~\ref{fig:nmf}, we present the ZH NMF bases as a
function of lookback time. 
We use two NMF components, so our ZH prescription has 2 free parameters.

        and ZH (right) used in the non-parametric SFH and ZH prescriptions of
        our SPS model. 
        These basis functions are derived from the SFHs and ZHs of simulated
        galaxies in the Illustris cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. 
        With the NMF basis functions, we can reproduce the wide range of SFHs
        and ZHs of Illustris galaxies (Appendix~\ref{sec:nmf}).  
    }
    \label{fig:nmf}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

We use the SFH and ZH above to model the unattenuated rest-frame luminosity as
a linear combination of multiple SSPs, evaluated at logarithmically-spaced
lookback time bins.
We use a fixed log-binning with the bin egdes starting with $(0, 10^{6.05}{\rm
yr})$, $(10^{6.05}, 10^{6.15}{\rm yr})$, and continuing on with bins of width
0.1 dex.
The binning is truncated at the age of the model galaxy. 
For a $z=0$ galaxy, this binning produces 43 $\tlb$ bins.
We use log-spaced $\tlb$ bins because it better reproduces galaxy luminosities
evaluated with much higher resolution $\tlb$ binning than linearly-spacing, for
the same number of bins. 
At each of the 43 $\tlb$ bin $i$, we evaluate the luminosity of a SSP with
${\rm ZH}(t_i)$, where $t_i$ is the center of $\tlb$ bin, and total stellar
mass calculated by resampling the SFH in Eq.~\ref{eq:sfh}. 
We use \fsps~to evaluate the SSP luminosities and use the MIST isochrones, the
combination of MILES and BaSeL spectral libraries, and the \cite{chabrier2003}
IMF (same as in Section~\ref{sec:sed}).  
Since we use MIST isochrones, we impose a minimum and maximum limit to ${\rm
ZH}$ based on its coverage: $4.49\times10^{-5}$ and $4.49\times10^{-2}$,
respectively.
These metallicity values are in units of absolute metallicity and can be
converted to solar metallicity using $Z_\odot = 0.019$. 
We note that our stellar metallicity range is significantly broader than
previous studies for additional flexibility~\citep[\emph{e.g.}][]{leja2017,
carnall2019a, tacchella2021}. 
Since we model galaxies solely as a linear combination of SSPs, we do not
model nebular emission.  
We, therefore, exclude emission lines in our SED modeling by masking the
wavelength ranges of emission lines.

Before we combine the SSP luminosities, we apply dust attenuation.
We use a two component \cite{charlot2000} dust attenuation model with birth
cloud (BC) and diffuse-dust (ISM) components. 
The BC component represents the extra dust attenuation of young stars that are
embedded in modecular clouds and HII regions. 
For SSPs younger than $t_i < 100{\rm Myr}$, we apply the
following BC dust attenuation: 
\begin{equation}
    L_i(\lambda) = L_i^{\rm unatten.}(\lambda) \exp\left[-\tau_{\rm BC} \left(
    \frac{\lambda}{5500\AA} \right)^{-0.7} \right].
\end{equation}
$\tau_{\rm BC}$ is the BC optical depth that determines the strength of the BC
attenuation. 
Afterwards, {\em all} SSPs are attenuated by the diffuse dust using the
\cite{kriek2013} attenuation curve parameterization: 
\begin{equation}
    L_i(\lambda) = L_i^{\rm unatten.}(\lambda) \exp\left[-\tau_{\rm ISM} \left(
    \frac{\lambda}{5500\AA} \right)^{n_{\rm dust}} \left(k_{\rm Cal}(\lambda) +
    D(\lambda) \right) \right].
\end{equation}
$\tau_{\rm ISM}$ is the diffuse dust optical depth.
$n_{\rm dust}$ is the \cite{calzetti2001} dust index, which determines the
slope of the attenuation curve. 
$k_{\rm Cal}(\lambda)$ is the \cite{calzetti2001} attenuation curve and
$D(\lambda)$ is the UV dust bump, parameterized using a Lorentzian-like Drude 
profile:
\begin{equation}
    D(\lambda) = \frac{E_b(\lambda~\Delta \lambda)^2}{(\lambda^2 -
    \lambda_0^2)^2 + (\lambda~\Delta \lambda)^2}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda_0 = 2175 \AA$, $\Delta \lambda = 350\AA$, and 
$E_b=0.85 - 1.9\,n_{\rm dust}$ are the central wavelength, full width at half
maximum, and strength of the bump, respectively. 
Once dust attenuation is applied to the SSPs, we sum them up to get the
rest-frame luminosity of the galaxy. 
In total, our SPS model has 12 free parameters: $M_*$, 4 SFH basis
coefficients, $f_{\rm burst}$, $t_{\rm burst}$, 2 ZH basis coefficients,
$\tau_{\rm BC}$, $\tau_{\rm ISM}$, and $n_{\rm dust}$. 

%description of our speculator SED model \citep{alsing2019}, which is based on FSPS. We use Chabrier IMF \ch{do we need to justify htis?}. 

In practice, each model evaulation using \fsps~requires ${\sim}340$ ms. 
%evaluating each SSP using \fsps~requires \ch{X} seconds.  For each model evaluation, we evaluate $\sim 43$ SSPs in each of the log-spaced $\tlb$ bins. 
Though this is not a prohibitive computational cost on its own, sampling a
high dimensional parameter space for inference requires $>100,000$ evaluations
--- \emph{i.e.} $\gtrsim10$ CPU hours \emph{per galaxy}. 
For the >10 million BGS galaxies, this would require >100 million CPU hours. 
Instead, we use an emulator for the model luminosity, which uses a PCA neural
network (NN) following the approach of \cite{alsing2019}. 

%The NN provides a flexible and accurate mapping between the SPS model
%parameters and PCA coefficients --- \emph{i.e.} the NN predicts PCA
%coefficients for a given set of SPS parameters. 
%Then the linear combination of the predicted coefficients and PCA basis
%functions give us the emulated model luminosity. 
%The PCA basis functions and NN are trained using 1,000,000 SPS parameters and
%model luminosity pairs, $\{(\theta, L(\lambda;\theta))\}$. 

To construct our emulator, we first generate $N_{\rm model} = 1,000,000$
model luminosities, $L(\lambda;\theta)$, from unique SPS parameters,
$\theta$, sampled from the prior (Section~\ref{sec:infer},
Table~\ref{tab:params}).
We then split the model luminosities into four wavelength bins: 2000 - 3600,
3600 - 5500, 5500 - 7410, and 7410 - $60000\AA$ with $N_{\rm spec}$ = 127, 2109,
2113, and 549 resolution elements, respectively.
For each wavelength bin, a PCA is done in the $N_{\rm spec}$-dimensional
space to yield PCA basis functions, or eigenspectra. 
We represent the model luminosity using the first $N_{\rm basis}$ = 50, 50, 50, and 30
eigenspectra and their corresponding PCA coefficients. 
A NN is then trained on the set of $N_{\rm model}$ models to
derive a mapping from the 12 SPS parameters to the $N_{\rm basis}$ PCA
coefficients for each wavelength bin. 


Once trained, our emulator works as follows.
For a given set of SPS parameters, the NN for each wavelength bin predicts
PCA coefficients. 
The coefficients are then linearly combined with the eigenspectra to
predict the model luminosity in the wavelength bin. 
The luminosity in all four wavelength bins are concatenated to produce the
full model luminosity. 
Throughout the wavelength range relevant for BGS, $3000 < \lambda < 9800\AA$,
we achieve $< 1\%$ accurate with the emulator. 
For details on the training, validation, and performance of our PCA NN
emulator, we refer readers to Kwon \etal~(in prep.). 
With the neural emulator, each model evaluation only requires 
${\sim}2.9$ ms --- 100$\times$ faster than with FSPS.

From the rest-frame luminosity, we obtain the observed-frame, redshifted, flux
in the same way as Eq.~\ref{eq:sed}.
In our case, redshift is not a free parameter since we will have high quality
spectroscopic redshifts for every DESI BGS galaxy.
BGS redshifts will have small redshift error, $\sigma_z < 0.0005 (1+z)$
(150 km/s), and <5\% catastrophic failures, $\Delta z/(1+z) < 0.003$ (<1000
km/s).
To model DESI photometry, we convolve the model flux with the LS broadband
filters as in Eq.~\ref{eq:photo}.
To model DESI spectra, we first apply Gaussian velocity dispersion. 
In this work, we keep velocity dispersion fixed at 0 km/s as a conservative
test for our SED modeling when we use an explicitly incorrect velocity
dispersion.
Later when we apply our SPS model to observations, the velocity dispersion will
be set to a more realistic value. 
It can also be set as a free parameter.
%In practice, however, the velocity dispersion can be set as a free parameter. 
After velocity dispersions, the broadened flux is resampled into the DESI
wavelength binning.  
Since DESI spectra do not necessarily include all the light of a galaxy, we
include a nuisance parameter $f_{\rm fiber}$, a normalization factor on the
spectra to account for fiber aperture effects. 
Next, the model photometry and spectrum can be directly compared to
observations.

\subsection{Bayesian Parameter Inference} \label{sec:infer} 
Using the SPS model above, we perform Bayesian parameter inference to derive
posterior probability distributions of the SPS parameters from photometry and
spectroscopy. 
From Bayes rule, we write down the posterior as
\begin{equation} \label{eq:bayes}
    p(\theta\given {\bf X}) \propto p(\theta)~p({\bf X} \given \theta)
\end{equation}
where ${\bf X}$ is the photometry or spectrum and $\theta$ is the set of SPS
parameters. 
$p({\bf X} \given \theta)$ is the likelihood, which we calculate independently for
the photometry
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}^{\rm photo} \propto \exp\left[-\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{X^{\rm photo} -
    m^{\rm photo}(\theta)}{\sigma^{\rm photo}}\right)\right]
\end{equation}
and for the spectrum
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}^{\rm spec} \propto \exp\left[-\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{X^{\rm spec} -
    m^{\rm spec}(\theta)}{\sigma^{\rm spec}} \right)^2\right].
\end{equation}
$m^{\rm photo}$ and $m^{\rm spec}$ represent SPS model photometry and spectroscopy. 
$\sigma^{\rm photo}$ and $\sigma^{\rm spec}$ respresent the uncertainties on
the measured photometry and spectrum. 
In calculating $\mathcal{L}^{\rm spec}$, we exclude wavelength ranges of width
40\AA~surrounding the OII, H$\beta$, OIII, and H$\alpha$ emission lines since
our SED model does not model gas emissions.
We consider the photometry indepedent from the spectrum so we combine the
likelihoods when jointly modeling the spectrophotometry: 
\begin{equation}
    \log \mathcal{L} \approx \log \mathcal{L}^{\rm photo} + \log
    \mathcal{L}^{\rm spec}.
\end{equation}
$p(\theta)$ in Eq.~\ref{eq:bayes} is the prior on the SPS parameters. 
For most of our parameters, we use uninformative uniform priors with
conservatively chosen ranges that are listed in Table~\ref{tab:params}. 
However, for the priors of $\{\beta_1, \beta_2, \beta_3, \beta_4 \}$, the NMF coefficients
for the SFH, we use a Dirichlet distribution to maintain the normalization of
the SFH in Eq.~\ref{eq:nmf}. 
With Dirichlet priors, $\beta_i$ are within $0 < \beta_i < 1$ and
satisfy the constraint $\sum_i \beta_i = 1$. 

Now that we can evaluate the posterior at given $\theta$, we estimate the
posterior distributions using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. 
We use the \cite{karamanis2020} ensemble slice sampling algorithm with the
{\sc zeus} Python
package\footnote{\href{https://zeus-mcmc.readthedocs.io/}{https://zeus-mcmc.readthedocs.io/}}. 
Ensemble slice sampling is an extension of standard slice sampling that does
not requires specifying the initial length scale or any further hand-tuning.
It generally converges faster than other MCMC algorithms (\emph{e.g.}
Metropolis) and generates chains with significantly lower autocorrelation.

When we sample the posterior, we do not directly sample our 12 dimensional
SPS parameter space because we use a Dirichlet prior on the SFH NMF
coefficients. 
Dirichlet distributions are difficult to directly sample so we instead use the
\cite{betancourt2012} sampling method, which transforms an $N$ dimensional
Dirichlet distribution into an easier to sample $N-1$ dimensional space.
Hence, we sample the posterior in the transformed 11 dimensional space. 
Given this dimensionality, we run our MCMC sampling with 30 walkers.
Overall, we find that the sampling converges after 2,500 iterations with a 500
iteration burn in. 
Deriving the posterior distribution from a joint SED modeling of photometry and
spectra, with the emulator, takes ${\sim}10$ CPU minutes per galaxy.
In principle, since our emulator uses a PCA NN, we can further expedite our
paremeter inference using more efficient sampling methods that exploit gradient
information, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.  
We will explore further speed ups to our SED modeling in future works. 

In Figure~\ref{fig:posterior} we present the posterior distribution of our 12
SPS model parameters for an arbitrarily chosen \lgal~mock observation. 
We mark the 68 and 95 percentiles of the distribution with the contours. 
The posterior distribution reveal there are significant degeneracies between
SPS parameters: \emph{e.g.} $\beta_2^{\rm SFH}$ and $f_{\rm burst}$. 
Furthermore, the distribution is multimodal (see $f_{\rm burst}$ panels). 
With our Bayesian SED modeling, we are able to capture such complexities in the
posterior that would be lost with point estimates or maximum likelihood
approaches.
In the bottom panels, we compare our SPS model evaluated at the best-fit
parameters (orange) with the \lgal~mock observations (black). 
On the left, we compare the $g$, $r$, $z$ band magnitudes; on the right, we
compare spectra. 
We find excellent agreement between the best-fit SPS model and mock
observations.

parameter inference framework, is publicly available at

\section{Inferring Galaxy Properties from Photometry and Spectra} \label{sec:methods}
\begin{itemize}
    \item overview of SED fitting
    \item describe our model (including description of speculator
        \cite{alsing2020}). And what assumptions that go into it: IMF, SFH and
        ZH bases, dust attenuation curve. 
    \item refer to appendix about different set ups 
    \item describe our MCMC sampling. James's work in convergence here.
        Detailed profiling of SED fitting and projections for full BGS. 
    \item be explicit about what physical properties are inferred from our SED
        fitting: stellar masses, ages, metallicities, star-formation histories.
        Expalin how we derive SFRs from the SFHs (i.e. our choice of 100Myr) 
    \item Figure that shows the posteriors as well as the best-fit  
    \item brief description of other standard SED fitting methods we include for
        comparison: firefly, VESPA, CIGALE
\end{itemize} 

Analysis of the mocks in section~\ref{sec:sims}, using standard and newly developed codes.

\section{Simulations}\label{sec:sims}
DESI, with its robotically-actuated and fibre-fed spectrographs, will collect 5000 spectra simultaneously. The spectra
cover the wavelength range 3600 to 9800 $\AA$, with a spectral resolution of $R
= \lambda/\Delta \lambda$ between 2000 and 5500.
During its five-year operation, starting in 2020, it will measure over 30
million spectra over $14,000~{\rm deg}^2$ of the sky (\todo{cite}). 
In addition, these DESI targets also have optical and infrared imaging data 
from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys~\citep[hereafter Legacy Surveys][]{dey2019}.
The Legacy Surveys are a combination of three public projects 
(Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey, Beijing-Arizona Sky Survey, and Mayall 
$z$-band Legacy Survey) that jointly imaged the ${\sim}14,000~{\rm deg}^2$ DESI 
footprint in three optical bands ($g$, $r$, and $z$). Furthermore, DR8 of the
Legacy Survey also includes photometry in the WISE $W1$, $W2$, $W3$, and $W4$ 
infrared bands. \todo{The infrared photometry is
from all imaging through year 4 of NEOWISE-Reactivation force-photometered 
in the unWISE maps at the locations of Legacy Surveys optical sources (cite).}
Below we describe how we simulate realistic DESI-like galaxy spectra and photometry 
from state-of-the-art simulations.

\subsection{Forward Modeled DESI Photometry} \label{sec:photo} 
From the noiseless source spetra generated for the galaxies in our simulations 
(Section~\ref{sec:lgal}), we generate noiseless photometry by convolving the
spectra with the broadband filters of DESI imaging: 
\begin{equation}
     f_X = \int f(\lambda) R_X(\lambda) {\rm d}\lambda
\end{equation}
$f(\lambda)$, $R_X$ is the transmission.

Next, we assign realistic photometric uncertainties to the simulated
photometric fluxes using the  


Afterwards, we impose the target selection criteria of BGS: $r < 20$. 
This leaves us with \todo{X} LGal galaxies.

    formation and metallicity histories} (Section~\ref{sec:sed}).  We assign
    uncertainties to the forward modeled photometry by \ch{matching the
    colors to the Legacy Survey imaging for BGS} (Section~\ref{sec:photo}).

    {\sc LGal} photometry is consistent with the color distribution of BGS
    targets from Legacy Survey imaging (black contours).} \label{fig:photo}

fiber flux assigned when we assigned photometric uncertainty

\begin{itemize} 
    \item 'true' fiber aperture SED generated by scaling down the SED by the 
    assigned $r$-band fiber flux. 
    \item Meanwhile we add some noise to the fiber flux to have
    'measured' fiber flux. 
    \item Furthermore, we later jointly fit photometry and spectra we marginalize over $f_{\rm fiber}$.
    \item run true fiber aperture SED through the DESI noise model to produce DESI-like spectra. 
    \item describe the noise model in detail

\caption{We construct forward model DESI spectra (blue) for our simulated galaxies by first
applying a fiber aperture correction to the SED (black solid), then applying a DESI noise model. 
We apply a fiber aperture correction by scaling down the SED based on the $r$-band aperture
flux we assign from the Legacy Surveys imaging. The noise model includes a DESI instrument 
model, which accounts for the DESI spectrograph response, and an atmosphere model, which 
accounts for the bright time observing conditions. We construct simulated DESI spectra for 
8 different bright time observing conditions. For more details, we refer readers to Section~\ref{sec:spec}.
